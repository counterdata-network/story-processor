        "story_text": "The Ukraine war sends message to ‘aggressors everywhere,’ says Blinken at Quad meeting\nBy Jessie Yeung and Manveena Suri, CNN\nMoscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and the support flooding in to Kyiv from countries across the world, sends a powerful message to “would be aggressors everywhere,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday during a panel discussion in New Delhi.\n“Part of the reason countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have effect here,” Blinken said, speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitics conference.\n“If we allow, with impunity, Russia to do what it’s doing in Ukraine, then that’s a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too,” he added.\nThe comments came as Blinken met with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia — a grouping known as the “Quad,” or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\nThe Quad is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s, though it has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.\nBlinken added that the challenges faced by people around the world cannot be dealt with by “any one country acting alone.”\n“The great power of the Quad is you have four like-minded countries, united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, experiences, different comparative ways to tackle these problems,” he said.\nThough he didn’t specify any “would-be aggressors,” he made several veiled references, saying the Quad is working on increasing countries’ maritime domain awareness — meaning greater surveillance on things happening in their waters — and tamping down on illegal fishing.\nTop US officials have previously called out China for illegal fishing operations that “plunder the region’s provisions,” and accused Beijing’s “maritime militias” of intimidating and harassing Indo-Pacific countries.\nChina has established the world’s largest naval force, built heavily-fortified islands in the South China Sea, and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters — frequently stoking tensions with its neighbors, and prompting promises from the US to stand by its partners in the region.\nThe Quad ministers reiterated the point in a joint statement on Friday, expressing “serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.”\nThough sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance — rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.\nIt does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.\nQuad members cooperate across various fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.\nBut security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses — and the Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s influence, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing in recent years.\nThe strategic location of each of the Quad nations — at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them — has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.\nThe joint statement on Friday also touched on other regional and international issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the military’s bloody coup two years ago, North Korea’s nuclear threat and increasingly aggressive missile testing, and the war in Ukraine.\nThe four ministers condemned the war “and the immense human suffering it is causing, and concurred that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,” according to the statement.\nThis story has been updated to clarify that Antony Blinken made his comments at a panel in New Delhi following the G20 summit.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Elon Musk pledged transparency at Twitter. But he’s walling off researchers\nBy Brian Fung, CNN\nFor years, Twitter, like other social media platforms, has freely given its platform data to independent researchers so that they can analyze everything from online trolling to the spread of misinformation. Those studies have been critical to understanding the tactics used by scammers, foreign influence campaigns and other malicious actors trying to manipulate social media.\nBut now researchers fear the future of that work is under threat, after Twitter abruptly announced plans last week to restrict access to this data and charge money for it.\nThe plan provided few details before it was delayed Wednesday amid a public backlash, but the company nonetheless intends to move forward with it. Twitter now says it will end free access to its application programming interface, or API, the software enabling third parties to tap into Twitter’s systems, on Feb. 13, and plans to replace it with paid access starting at $100 a month for “basic access” granting a “low level of API usage.”\nSuch a change would chill civic research on Twitter manipulation and have devastating consequences for transparency, accountability and the public good, said Rebekah Tromble, director of George Washington University’s Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics.\n“It’s just abundantly clear that the impact is going to be profound on the research community, profound on civil society organizations that rely on free access to the API in order to provide a vitally important public service,” Tromble told CNN. “Twitter essentially has gone, in a blink of an eye, from being an industry leader in transparency to the bottom of the barrel.”\nThe plan highlights the tension between new owner Elon Musk’s vows to bolster transparency on Twitter’s platform and the pressure he faces to shore up revenue through subscription products in order to improve the company’s bottom line, particularly in the face of an advertiser revolt.\nTwitter’s plan to restrict access to data also comes as it boasted to European Union authorities, in a report made public Thursday, that it provides “industry-leading access to data.”\n“Since 2006, academic researchers have used data from the public conversation to study topics as diverse as the conversation on Twitter itself,” the report said, “from state-backed efforts to disrupt the public conversation to floods and climate change, from attitudes and perceptions about COVID-19 to efforts to promote healthy conversation online.”\n“Today, academic researchers are one of the largest groups of people using the Twitter API,” the report added. But Twitter’s changes erecting a paywall for API access may jeopardize all that, Tromble and other researchers said.\nThe company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUndermining the fight against bots\nMusk has framed Twitter’s API restrictions as part of his wider effort to stamp out spammy, automated accounts. The data interface “is being abused badly right now by bot scammers and opinion manipulators,” he tweeted last week. “There’s no verification process or cost, so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things.”\nBut Musk’s proposed cure — putting a price on platform access — triggered a backlash from third-party software developers behind so-called “good” Twitter bots that also could be harmed by the change. Two days later, Musk seemed to soften his stance, but his concession only appeared to address the concerns of developers who use the API to write automated tweets, said Tromble, not those of researchers who use the API to collect and analyze large volumes of platform data.\nMusk’s allegations about the prevalence of bots on Twitter were a centerpiece of his attempt last year to back out of buying Twitter, an ultimately unsuccessful effort. Ironically, however, Musk’s looming changes to the Twitter API might make it harder to study bot behavior on Twitter.\nOne of the third-party applications that depends on Twitter’s API is Botometer, a tool developed by Indiana University researchers and that was heavily cited by Musk’s team in court to defend his claims that Twitter was ridden with “bad” bots.\nKaicheng Yang, one of the creators of Botometer, told CNN Thursday that Twitter’s coming API changes “would definitely make my work harder” and raise the project’s costs. Yang said he would attempt to find funding to keep the project going, but that users could ultimately have to bear the costs of Botometer’s use of Twitter’s API, which he said could be “prohibitive” and drive people away from the tool.\n“We also teach students in the classroom about how to use our tools to study social media and understand online manipulation. With the paid API, we won’t be able to do that anymore,” Yang said. He also added that even if Botometer can somehow continue, other researchers with smaller budgets, particularly in developing countries, likely won’t be able to afford Twitter’s API.\n‘Not affordable’ to researchers\nWhile it’s no surprise that Twitter might ask researchers to chip in for data access, the company has made little effort to understand researchers’ constraints and whether paying $100 a month is even feasible, said Tromble.\n“There’s been no conversation with the affected community,” she said. “$100 a month is affordable to scholars at Ivy League institutions; it’s not affordable to under-resourced academic and civil-society researchers. If Twitter had that community in mind, it would be absolutely appropriate for them to reach out and have some conversations and perhaps introduce a sliding scale approach to this.”\nGiven the breadth of research worldwide based on Twitter data, dealing with topics ranging from elections to the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact on smaller research organizations could be substantial. Last week, more than 100 civil society groups and more than 500 individuals signed an open letter urging Twitter to keep its API easily accessible to researchers.\n“Twitter’s new CEO Elon Musk has promised to make the platform more transparent and to reduce the prevalence of spam and manipulative accounts,” the letter said. “In fact, the independent research community has developed many of the most cutting-edge techniques used to manage bots. API access has provided a critical resource for that work. Twitter’s new barriers to data access will reduce the very transparency that both the platform and our societies desperately need.”\nThe impending API paywall also follows Twitter’s decision to eliminate a partnership with researchers known as the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium. The initiative was launched as recently as last year and had just gotten off the ground when Musk took over the company and axed the program, said Tromble, who described the consortium as an industry-leading push for transparency.\n“The team is gone,” she said. “The researchers who were signed up to the program have heard nothing from the company in months, since Musk’s acquisition.”\nAdding to Twitter’s scrutiny by regulators\nBeyond the immediate impact to researchers, Twitter’s transparency issues could land the company in hot water with policymakers.\nLast week, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan called Twitter’s API plans “the latest in a series of bad moves from Twitter under Elon Musk’s leadership.”\n“Twitter should be making it easier to study what’s happening on its platform, not harder,” Trahan said in a statement, citing a briefing her staff received from Twitter in December in which Twitter committed not to limit researcher access to the platform.\nUS policymakers have broadly called for expanding researcher access to social media data as a way of holding platforms accountable. Several other platforms that filed reports to the European Union — reports that were also made public Thursday alongside Twitter’s — indicated a commitment to growing that access, said Tromble.\n“Meta was able to point to new programs they were developing,” Tromble said. “TikTok was able to point to specific, new APIs they’re developing. Twitter simply had blanks. There was nothing they could say, and in fact what they did say was, ‘We’re already better than everyone else,’ which was true until a week ago.”\nThe reports to the EU are seen as an important baseline marker for compliance with the Code of Practice on Disinformation, a voluntary set of self-regulatory commitments that can reduce a tech company’s potential liability under the Digital Services Act, a recently passed EU content moderation law that will be enforced beginning in 2024. Violations of the Digital Services Act can lead to fines of up to 6% of a platform’s global annual revenue.\n“More work is needed when it comes to providing access to data for researchers,” said Věra Jourová, the European Union’s vice-president for values and transparency, in a statement. “We must have more transparency and cannot rely on the online platforms alone for the quality of information. They need to be independently verifiable. I am disappointed to see that Twitter’s report lags behind others and I expect a more serious commitment to their obligations stemming from the Code.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "How AI could power the climate breakthrough the world needs\nBy Clare Duffy and Rachel Ramirez, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Tomato growers in central India have been increasingly worried about the volatility that extreme weather events have brought to the region. For much of the area, the last decade has been punctuated by severe droughts that led to significant crop loss, impacting the livelihoods of local farmers.\nOn the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades. The tool uses data on the climate, water and soil of a particular location to measure how viable the landscape will be for growing in the coming years.\nMaharashtra, India, was one of its first case studies in 2021. Farmers could go into the ClimateAi app and input what seed they were growing and where they wanted to plant it.\nWith that data, ClimateAi ran simulations and found that extreme heat and drought would lead to an approximately 30% decrease in tomato output in the region over the next two decades. It warned growers that they should change their strategy.\nThe results proved pivotal â tomato producers adjusted their business plans by switching to more climate-resilient seed varieties and shifting the times they plant tomato seeds. Finding new growing locations usually takes a while for farmers affected by climate change, but ânow it can happen in a matter of minutes, and it also saves them a lot of cost,â according to Himanshu Gupta, who grew up in India and is the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.\nâThe way we think about AI is itâs a time and effectiveness multiplier to the solutions for climate change,â Gupta told CNN.\nBetter assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways artificial intelligence technologies are being used to address the climate crisis.\nAI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate researchers have for years been thinking about how AI â computer programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete complex tasks in ways similar to how a human might â could help them better understand and address the changing climate.\nNow, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing pollution to improving weather models.\nâEfficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing decisions, optimizing resources,â said Fengqi You, chair professor at Cornell Universityâs engineering school. âItâs a system that has very strong predictive capabilities that could be tremendously helpful in many domains, ranging from (understanding) small-scale molecules â¦ to broader climate systems to help us fight climate change.â\nWith the breakneck pace at which the planet has been warming,Â accelerating the speed at which the world deploys and implements solutions is crucial. But for all of AIâs promise, the infrastructure that supports the technology â data centers filled with rows of powerful, energy-sucking computers â could itself be a strain on the environment. Experts say software engineers must work closely with climate scientists to find a balance.\nâItâs definitely something that has to be considered as this trade-off,â said Kara Lamb, an associate research scientist at Columbia Universityâs earth and environmental engineering department. Still, âthe positives outweigh the negatives in terms of applying it to these types of approaches.â\nTechnology that speeds up discovery\nArtificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to various digital tools trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required input from an actual person. Generally, what these technologies have in common is their ability to rapidly process and find connections among vast amounts of disparate data.\nThis makes AI particularly good at things like forecasting and running simulations. And unlike traditional computer programs, AI tools can typically continue learning over time as new data is available or as the systems receive new feedback about the quality of their outputs.\nWhile scientific discovery used to be reliant on humansâ ability to gather, observe and analyze evidence, computers can now process large datasets, identify patterns and run digital experiments in a fraction of the time that human researchers would need.\nâFor the climate models, fundamentally weâre trying to solve these equations â¦ how these atmosphere models are interacting, and it takes a long time to solve,â You said. Similarly, research on new energy conduction materials, like those for solar panels, could require countless hours of testing that can now be sped up using AI.\nâIn the past, people used to need trial and error, weâd need â¦ researchers working every day and night,â You said. âNow, because of AI, which doesnât need to sleep, it just needs electric power, it could keep working 24/7 and it can become very helpful in accelerating discovery.â\nAI probably wonât replace the need for humans in the climate change fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective.\nResearchers seeking to restore coastlines by replanting seagrass, for example, are using AI to model the best locations to target those replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at impact investing firm Newday, which is involved in charitable efforts to support the coastal restoration.\nAn AI algorithm trained to address the issue could take into consideration everything from toxins in the water or disruptive shipping routes to how replanting efforts could impact nearby sea life or even coastal tourism.\nâItâs very difficult to put all those together into a single model with conventional methods, but AI actually makes that much more possible,â Keeler said.\nAI âdoing the dirty workâ in climate research\nThe Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have found. Rising temperatures are melting sea ice, thawing permafrost and igniting wildfires in what should be one of the coldest regions on Earth.\nClimate experts have said what happens in the Arctic is a bellwether for the rest of the world. But climate models â which scientists use to predict long-term change â are not capturing how fast itâs warming.\nWith the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal timescale, instead of on the typical 100-year timescale, giving her and other researchers a better picture of how fast the Arctic is melting.\nâAI is doing the dirty work,â Liljedahl told CNN. âBut AI is not perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore the things that AI suggested.â\nThe technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be highest, allowing grid operators to âmake sure they have power online, ready to supply demand, and also that they donât have power thatâs just being produced and itâs going to be consumed, because thatâs obviously a tremendous waste,â said Keeler.\nClimateAiâs Gupta said the problem is figuring out how to integrate renewable capacity into the existing fossil fuel-dominated grid. AI can identify in real-time which renewable energy sources are available in the areas where consumers want it â optimizing consumer demand and supply for renewables.\nElsewhere, AI is also being used to research materials that could effectively recapture carbon from the atmosphere and to model and forecast major floods to help local government agencies better prepare for and react to potential emergencies.\nThe Cool Down, a media company aiming to help consumers better understand the climate crisis and potential solutions, is set to launch an AI tool early next year that will answer user questions about how to live a more sustainable lifestyle, according to Anna Robertson, co-founder and head of content and partnerships. The tool will use data from its site about what kinds of climate information consumers are most curious about to direct users to information, including answering questions like, âWhat can I do with my old jeans?â or âI want to switch my laundry detergent, where should I start?â\nâPart of the problem is that the issue itself has become so overwhelming and mostly dominated by doom and gloom and not the solutions we have at our fingertips,â Robertson told CNN. âWe want to make it easier for people to make better choices.â\nFinding the right balance\nThereâs a downside to all this computational power: Running artificial intelligence models is energy-intensive,Â and many data centers are operated in areas that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Cornellâs You said. Data centers also typically require water for cooling â a dwindling resource in some places where this computing is being done, including the American West.\nFor now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small compared to whatâs consumed by transportation or buildings. âBut this is going to grow very fast, and we do need to be very careful at this moment before it grows exponentially,â You said.\nAn October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the âworst-case scenarioâ suggests Googleâs AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. Developers should be advised ânot only to focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,â the study concludes.\nSome data center operators are already beginning to address these concerns.\nAmazon Web Services, the online shopping giantâs cloud computing arm, has pledged to be âwater positiveâ by 2030, meaning the company will âreturn more water to the communities in which we have our data center infrastructure than we take,â CEO Adam Selipsky told CNN in an October interview.\nIn Oregon, for example, where drought has tightened its grip in recent years, AWS is providing the spent water used for cooling its data centers to local farmers for irrigation at no cost.\nThe companies building and running data centers to carry out AI workloads can also think about strategically placing them in areas where they might require fewer natural resources to operate, You said. If data centers are built in colder parts of the world, for example, less water will be needed for cooling; Scandanavia has emerged as a popular location for data centers, also bolstered by its relatively robust availability of renewable energy sources.\nLawmakers in the United States and abroad â who have in recent months increasingly turned their attention to developing guardrails for AI â should consider both the technologyâs potential benefits in fighting climate change and its environmental impact when developing regulations, You added.\nâRegulators, decision makers, policymakers really need to think about this when they are looking at the growth of [the AI] industry,â You said. âThe growth of the industry is not only about the software, tools and so on, but also how they operate these data centers.â\nTech experts also caution that AI must be made affordable and accessible for low-income nations, particularly those in the Global South that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet contribute the least to global pollution, something Gupta hopes to address as he expands ClimateAiâs resources.\nâWhen it comes to AI being applied to climate change,â said Gupta, âI think we are just scratching the surface of the potential that exists both in terms of the impact it could create for businesses, but also the impact it could create at the humanity level.â\nThis story has been updated to note that Himanshu Gupta is both the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "John Roberts takes center stage in the battle over student loan forgiveness\nBy Joan Biskupic, CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst\nChief Justice John Roberts pounded away on the price tag — “about half a trillion dollars” — for the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program during oral arguments Tuesday. But as he repeatedly cited the big cost, he reinforced a broader, more familiar point that could further undercut executive power and enhance the Supreme Court itself.\nRoberts was especially active in the center chair, asserting the court’s authority and his own, during a session that lasted three and a half hours. Now in his 18th term, Roberts has sometimes struggled to control his colleagues, the majority of whom reside to his ideological right but these cases afforded him a commanding presence in an area of the law he’s been driving.\nThe 68-year-old Roberts pressed an emerging “major questions doctrine,” embraced by the right and generally forbidding agency actions on matters of vast economic and political significance without clear authority from Congress.\nHe also showed an attitude toward basic policy choices, as he questioned the fairness of federal assistance for a student who had taken out a college loan, over someone who’d never had a college opportunity and instead started a lawn care service.\n“Along comes the government and tells that person: You don’t have to pay your loan,” Roberts said of a hypothetical college loan borrower. “Nobody’s telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn service business that he doesn’t have to pay his loan. He still does, even though his tax dollars are going to support the forgiveness of the loan for the college graduate, who’s now going to make a lot more than him over the course of his lifetime.”\nThe cases tested whether a 2003 statute permitting the secretary of Education to “waive or modify” federal student loans in national emergencies could be used, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, to forgive loans for more than 40 million borrowers. The lawsuits were brought by six Republican-led states and two borrowers who were ineligible for the full relief of up to $20,000 in individual loan forgiveness.\nIn recent years, the conservative majority has invoked variations on a “major questions doctrine” as it curtailed Biden administration initiatives to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (an eviction moratorium and then emergency vaccination and testing requirements) and to protect air quality through limits on power plant emissions.\nLast June, in the power plant emissions decision, which Roberts wrote, the court held that regulations raising “major questions,” such as those around the climate-change crisis, should be permitted only if an agency can “point to clear congressional authorization” for its action.\nUS Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the Biden program, tried to blunt that approach as she stepped to the lectern.\n“Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts,” Prelogar said. “Loan forgiveness is a paradigmatic form of debt relief, and the secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the HEROES Act (of 2003) in providing that relief here. To apply the major questions doctrine to override that clear text would deny borrowers critical relief that Congress authorized, and the secretary deemed essential.”\nRoberts was skeptical at every turn: “We’re talking about a half-trillion dollars and 43 million Americans. How does that fit under the normal understanding of ‘modifying’?”\nLater, he was more explicit.\n“I think most casual observers would say, if you’re going to give up that much amount of money, if you’re going to affect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that’s of great controversy, they would think that’s something for Congress to act on,” Roberts said. “And if they haven’t acted on it, then maybe that’s a good lesson to say for the president or the administrative bureaucracy that maybe that’s not something they should undertake on their own.”\nPrelogar said that the HEROES Act, officially known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, was broadly written to allow the secretary of education to handle a range of emergencies.\n“Congress wanted to cover the waterfront and ensure in advance that the secretary had the tools depending on whatever situation he confronted to make sure that student-loan borrowers weren’t going to be left worse off,” she told the justices.\nShe acknowledged the significant costs and major policy at issue, but said, “I think that that applies to any number of actions that the government might take, and especially in the context of a benefits program, where just based on the size of those programs and the numbers of individuals affected, the costs can frequently run into the billions of dollars.”\nPrelogar’s arguments were bolstered by the three liberals among the nine. Sonia Sotomayor, the senior justice on the left, warned that judges would seize greater power if agency authority to carry out acts of Congress were diminished.\nAddressing Nebraska state Solicitor General James Campbell, who argued against the Biden administration, Sotomayor said, “What you’re saying is now we’re going to give judges the right to decide how much aid to give them. Instead of the person with the expertise and the experience, the secretary of education, who’s been dealing with educational issues and the problems surrounding student loans, we’re going to take it upon ourselves, instead of leaving that decision in the hands of the person who has experience with these questions.”\nSuch a shift in power among the branches has been highlighted in the past. Last year, in the power plant emissions case, Justice Elena Kagan protested that the relatively recent “major questions” approach usurped the expertise of agencies.\n“The Court appoints itself — instead of Congress or the expert agency — the decisionmaker on climate policy,” Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion. “I cannot think of many things more frightening.”\nOn Tuesday, Kagan asserted that the HEROES Act was clear regarding the secretary of education’s authority in national emergencies to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision” of student financial assistance.\n“Congress didn’t say exactly the circumstances in which it wanted the secretary to use this authority. Of course not.” This was legislation for emergencies, she stressed, adding, “We deal with congressional statutes every day that are really confusing. This one is not.”\nA few beats later, Roberts implicitly rejoined with the recent precedent of the conservative supermajority. He pointed to cases in which the court had found that a statute’s provisions covered the authority an agency sought to exercise, but “that given the nature of the authority and its consequences,” those terms were simply “not clear enough.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Extreme heat, fires and floods threaten Europeâs economy\nBy Olesya Dmitracova, CNN\nLondon (CNN) — Mounting climate risks, illustrated by the extreme heat, wildfires and floods that ravaged parts of Europe this summer, could hurt the regionâs economy as soon as this year, the European Commission warned Monday.\nIn its latest economic forecast, the European Unionâs executive arm downgraded its predictions for growth in the region in 2023 and 2024. But even that gloomier outlook could prove too optimistic, it said.\nâThe materialization of these [climate] risks bears severe costs for the EU economy, in terms of losses in natural capital and deterioration of economic activity, including tourism,â the commission said.\nIt now expects the EUâs gross domestic product to grow 0.8% this year, down from a 1% rise forecast in the spring. Next yearâs growth has been revised to 1.4% from 1.7%.\nThe commission blamed weak domestic demand, dampened by high inflation, as well as rising interest rates for the downgrades. But it added that there was âformidable uncertaintyâ over its latest forecast, with extreme weather among the âdownsideâ risks.\nNo Roman holiday?\nTourism can account for as much as a fifth of annual GDP in some countries in the region. Europeans are already starting to rethink where to vacation in the future after this yearâs scorching temperatures in southern Europe and the hottest summer ever recorded on the continent in 2022.\nThe European Travel Commission, an association of tourism organizations, said in July that the number of European tourists planning to travel to Mediterranean destinations in the summer and fall this year had dropped 10% compared with the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark, where the weather is milder, had seen a âsurge in popularity,â the ETC noted.\nTravelers from outside the EU may likewise lose their taste for vacations in Italy and Greece, both of which have been battling wildfires. A spokesperson at ForwardKeys, a travel data company, told CNN in July that âthere has been a shift in preference towards cooler and more northern destinationsâ among UK travelers as a result of heat waves in continental Europe that month.\nGlobal warming could dent tourism in another way: by accelerating the erosion of beaches and amplifying wildfires that rip through forests â both part of Europeâs ânatural capital,â David Owen, chief economist at Saltmarsh Economics, told CNN.\nIn a study published last October, the Bank of Italy warned that rising temperatures risked stunting growth in the EUâs third-biggest economy, with tourism and agriculture most exposed.\nThe blistering temperatures have already been bad news for olive trees, for a second year running, with industry experts warning of skyrocketing prices and potential shortages of olive oil. In Spain, the worldâs biggest olive oil producer, production has already plunged.\nThe full extent of the damage from this yearâs heat wonât be known until after harvest time in October and November, but European olive oil production could sink by 700,000 metric tons â a fall of more than 30% â compared with its five-year average, according to Kyle Holland at market research group Mintec.\nConstruction and manufacturing are among other economic sectors vulnerable to extreme heat, said Owen at Saltmarsh Economics.\nâIf youâre having to learn to live with temperatures topping 40 degrees [Celsius] for a few days at a time in parts of southern Europe, we donât function very well at those sorts of temperatures, so it will impact economies more generally,â he added.\nSimilarly to the European Commission, on Sunday the International Monetary Fund pointed to âgrave risks to economic well-beingâ from climate change.\nâG20 members must lead by example in delivering on the promises of $100 billion per year for climate finance,â IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at the Group of 20 summit in India.\nâCountries also need to mobilize domestic resources to finance and manage the green transition through tax reforms, effective and efficient public spending, strong fiscal institutions, and deep local debt markets.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Biden administration approves controversial Willow oil project in Alaska, which has galvanized online activism\nBy Ella Nilsen, CNN\nThe Biden administration has approved the massive Willow oil drilling project in Alaska, angering climate advocates and setting the stage for a court challenge.\nThe Willow Project is a decadeslong oil drilling venture in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned by the federal government. The area where the project is planned holds up to 600 million barrels of oil, though that oil would take years to reach the market since the project has yet to be constructed.\nBy the administration’s own estimates, the project would generate enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year — equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.\nThe approval is a victory for Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation and a coalition of Alaska Native tribes and groups who hailed the drilling venture as a much-needed new source of revenue and jobs for the remote region.\n“We finally did it, Willow is finally reapproved, and we can almost literally feel Alaska’s future brightening because of it,” Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement, adding that Alaska is “now on the cusp of creating thousands of new jobs, generating billions of dollars in new revenues” and “improving quality of life on the North Slope and across our state.”\nBut it is a major blow to climate groups and Alaska Natives who opposed Willow and argued the project will hurt the president’s ambitious climate goals and pose health and environmental risks.\nThe project has galvanized an uprising of online activism against it, including more than one million letters written to the White House in protest of the project, and a Change.org petition with millions of signatures.\nEnvironmental advocates are expected to challenge the project in court. Earthjustice, an environmental law group, has been preparing a case against the project and intends to argue the Biden administration’s authority to protect resources on Alaska’s public lands includes taking steps to reduce planet-warming carbon pollution, which the Willow Project would ultimately add to.\nEarthjustice President Abigail Dillen blasted the administration’s decision on Monday.\n“We are too late in the climate crisis to approve massive oil and gas projects that directly undermine the new clean economy that the Biden Administration committed to advancing,” Dillen said. “We know President Biden understands the existential threat of climate, but he is approving a project that derails his own climate goals.”\nYet federal lawmakers from Alaska cheered the decision, calling it a win for the state.\n“After years of consistent, determined advocacy for this project, from people all across the state and from every walk of life, the Willow Project is finally moving forward,” said Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native in Congress. “I would like to thank the President and his administration for listening to the voices of Alaskans when it mattered most.”\nAlaska Native groups who wanted the project for the jobs and revenue it would bring to the region also hailed the decision.\nNagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, said in a statement Monday that his group was “grateful” to President Joe Biden and his senior advisers for approving the project and “heeding the will of Alaska Native communities in support of the Willow Project.”\n“The Willow Project is a new opportunity to ensure a viable future for our communities, creating generational economic stability for our people and advancing our self-determination,” Harcharek said.\nIn recent weeks, the Biden administration had looked at reducing the number of approved drilling pads down to two and boosting nature conservation measures to try to assuage concerns climate and environmental groups had about the project. Reducing the drill-pads to two would have allowed the company to drill about 70% of the oil they were initially seeking.\nBut ConocoPhillips and Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation aggressively lobbied the Biden White House and Interior Department for months to approve three drilling pads, saying the project would not be economically viable with two.\nThe venture was ultimately approved with three drilling pads. The administration felt it was constrained legally and had few options to cancel or significantly curtail the project — which was initially approved by the Trump administration. The administration determined that legally, courts wouldn’t have allowed them to fully reject the project, two government sources familiar with the approval told CNN.\nThe final scope of the project will cover 68,000 fewer acres than what ConocoPhillips was initially seeking, the sources said.\n“This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,” Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Willow fits within the Biden Administration’s priorities on environmental and social justice, facilitating the energy transition and enhancing our energy security, all while creating good union jobs and providing benefits to Alaska Native communities.”\nBiden on Monday also announced sweeping new protections for federal land and waters in Alaska in tandem with Willow approval.\nThe White House on Monday made the entire US Arctic Ocean off limits to future oil and gas leasing. The administration will also later announce new rules to protect more than 13 million acres in the federal National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska from drilling.\nIn all, the administration will move to protect up to 16 million acres from future fossil fuel leasing.\nThe protections will extend to the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon and Peard Bay special areas — places that are important habitats for grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou and migratory birds.\nOn Sunday, an administration official said the administration views the new actions as a “firewall” against both future fossil fuel leasing and expansion of existing projects on the North Slope.\nAs he lauded the decision to approve the Willow Project, Sen. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, criticized the forthcoming protective measures.\n“The fact that this Willow [approval] comes with the announcement of future legally-dubious resource development restrictions on Alaska lands and waters is infuriating and demonstrates that the Biden Administration’s unprecedented lock-up of our state will continue,” Sullivan said in a statement.\nSullivan told reporters on Monday that the Biden administration assured him that the existing lease rights in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska would not be affected by the new rules.\nEnvironmental groups lashed out at the Biden administration for its approval of Willow and said the increased protections for other Arctic regions will not undo the harm the project will cause.\nTiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, said the league is “extremely disappointed” in the decision, calling the project “dangerous” and “dirty.”\n“This is in direct conflict with the Biden-Harris administration’s goals of cutting climate pollution in half by 2030, and it’s now all the more important they double down on executive action that maximizes climate and conservation progress,” Sittenfeld said in a statement. “The new protections announced for the threatened Arctic are important, but they do not make up for Willow’s approval.”\nLena Moffitt, the executive director of Evergreen Action, which advocates for strong climate change policies, called the approval “an unacceptable departure from President Biden’s promises to the American people on climate and environmental justice.”\nThe Alaska Wilderness League, which works to protect Alaska’s natural areas from industry and fossil fuel drilling, said it was “deeply disappointed” in the approval.\n“This is the wrong decision for our climate future, for protecting biodiversity, and for honoring the frontline communities who have raised their voices against this project,” said Kristen Miller, the executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League.\nSen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, called the approval from Biden and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland “disappointing.”\n“The western Arctic is one of the last great wild landscapes on the planet,” Heinrich said in a statement. “Industrial development in this unspoiled landscape will not age well.”\nThis story has been updated with more information.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Lula says Brazil is no more divided than the US as he meets Biden\nBy Tara John, CNN\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the divisions in his country were no worse than the political split in the United States, in an exclusive CNN interview Friday ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House.\n“Here there’s also a split, much more, or as serious as Brazil — Democrats and Republicans are very split up. Love it or leave it, that’s more or less what’s going on,” he told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Washington, adding that Brazil does not have “a hatred culture.”\nBoth Lula and Biden saw government buildings sacked in the aftermath of their presidential elections by far-right elements that have posed huge tests for their respective democracies.\n“Never could we imagine that in a country that was the symbol of democracy in the world — someone could try to invade the Capitol,” he said about the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot in the US.\nThe similarities between the January 8 attack on Brasilia and the US insurrection include former President Jair Bolsonaro’s close alignment with former US President Donald Trump.\nLula calls Bolsonaro a “faithful copycat of Trump,” saying both men “don’t enjoy trade unions… They don’t like workers, don’t like women. They don’t like Black people.”\nBoth ex-leaders were repeatedly criticized during their terms for using racist and misogynistic language.\nEven so, Lula is not convinced all Bolsonaro supporters are adherents to his views. “I am convinced that not everybody that voted for Bolsonaro follows Bolsonarism,” he said.\nAfter his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States. He has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month, prompting some Democratic Party lawmakers to call for him to leave the country.\nWill Lula ask Biden to help extradite Bolsonaro back to Brazil? “I don’t know, I’m not going to talk about President Biden about that, this will depend on courts,” he replied. “One day he has to come back to Brazil and face all the lawsuits against him.”\nBolsonaro faces “almost 12 lawsuits against him in Brazil, more cases will come in,” Lula said, adding that he believes his former rival will “be convicted in some international court because of the genocide with Covid (outbreak) because half of the people that died in Brazil during Covid was the responsibility of the federal government.”\nHe also alleged that Bolsonaro could be “punished” by courts for “the genocide against the Yanomami indigenous people” after illegal mining in their protected territory soared during his term.\nBrazil’s Supreme Court has ordered an investigation to determine whether the actions of the Bolsonaro government amounted to “genocide” of the Yanomami — who have seen disease and malnutrition tear through their community in the last four years.\nBolsonaro has previously called such accusation a “left-wing farce” on his official Telegram channel.\nBiden talks\nLula’s talks with Biden on Friday are expected to center around combating climate change and tackling anti-democratic extremism.\nWhile Lula believes “democracy will prevail” in Brazil, he worries about about the rise of extreme right groups around the world.\n“It’s in Brazil, it’s in Spain, it’s in France, and they are in Hungary, in Germany. We have an organized extreme right in the world and if we’re not careful, this will be a Nazi attitude from there. This is a denial attitude we haven’t seen before,” he said.\nHe agrees there is much to be done in Brazil about the climate, saying the country’s commitment to “reduce greenhouse emissions” by 39% would have to include rewarding local “mayors and governors, who guarantee no more burning of the forests.”\nBy extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hopes to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere’s key players.\nBiden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula’s officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties.\nThey have met previously — when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro.\nWhile they have much in common, Lula — like many leaders in middle income and developing countries — has adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine.\nHe has rebuffed efforts led by Biden to unite the global community in opposition to Russia’s invasion.\nSpeaking to CNN, Lula said that Ukraine had the right to defend itself “because the invasion was a mistake on the part of Russia.”\nHe explained he refused to provide ammunition to Ukraine because, “I don’t want to go join the war. I want to end the war.”\nLula has sought be a global statesman who could broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine, telling CNN that he has begun this “work” by speaking to the German Chancellor, who visited Brazil in January.\n“I want to talk about peace with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I want to talk about peace with President Biden, I want to talk about peace with (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping. I want to talk about peace with India, with Indonesia… because for me the world will only develop itself if we have peace,” he said.\nAnother thing Lula shares with Biden is age. They are both elderly presidents: Biden is 80 years old, while Lula is 77.\nWhen asked about it, Lula said aging only exists for those who don’t have a cause to fight for.\n“I am 77 years of age, and … I have the energy and power of someone who is 30 years old,” he said. “I don’t sleep because my home is the Brazilian people — I have to improve the lives of my people.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Global water crisis could ‘spiral out of control’ due to overconsumption and climate change, UN report warns\nBy Sana Noor Haq, CNN\nThe world is facing a looming global water crisis that threatens to “spiral out of control” as increased demand for water and the intensifying impacts of the climate crisis put huge pressure on water resources, a UN report has warned.\nWater use has increased by about 1% a year over the last 40 years, driven by population growth and changing consumption patters, according to the UN World Water Development Report published Tuesday, on the eve of a major UN water summit in New York.\nBy 2050, the number of people in cities facing water scarcity is projected to nearly double from 930 million people in 2016 to up to 2.4 billion, the report found. Urban water demand is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.\nWithout action to address the problem of water scarcity, “there definitely will be a global crisis,” said Richard Connor, the report’s lead author, at a news conference to launch the report.\n‘Dire consequences’\nWater access is already a huge problem. Two billion people do not currently have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.\nAbout 10% of the global population already lives in countries with high or critical water stress.\nUrban and industrial growth and agriculture are compounding existing shortages, with agriculture alone using up 70% of the world’s water supply, Connor said.\nSeasonal water scarcity is set to increase in areas where water is currently plentiful including in Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America, the report found. Meanwhile, scarcity will worsen in the Middle East and the Sahel region in Africa, where water is already in short supply.\nExtreme and prolonged droughts, made more frequent and severe by the climate crisis, are also putting pressure on ecosystems, which could have “dire consequences” for plant and animal species, the report’s authors said.\nSolutions include better international cooperation to avoid conflicts over water, Connor said.\nFlood and pollution control, data sharing and efforts to reduce levels of planet-heating pollution should “open the door to further collaboration and increase access to water funds,” he said.\n“There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiraling out of control,” said Audrey Azoulay, the director general of UNESCO, the UN’s cultural body.\n“Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Water carved New Zealand’s stunning landscape. Now too much is risking lives\nBy Hilary Whiteman, CNN\nNew Zealand’s Hawke’s Bay is known for its fine wine, but many of the region’s vineyards are now under water, along with homes and roads in the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle.\nThe weather system didn’t make landfall in New Zealand, but it caused widespread destruction, killing at least seven people, displacing thousands, destroying roads and cutting access to smaller communities in the country’s northeast.\nPrime Minister Chris Hipkins flew over the flood-hit areas on Thursday and said the “extensive” damage had made it clear the country was unprepared for extreme weather events — and there is a lot of work to be done.\n“We’re talking about roading, we’re talking about telecommunications, we’re talking about electricity and energy. There’s no question, we’ve got some big challenges ahead,” he said, while visiting the flood-ravaged city of Gisborne.\n“We can’t continue the way that we have been going. We are going to see more of these types of weather events. So we have to be prepared.”\nHipkins didn’t mention the climate crisis by name, but his climate change minister James Shaw made the link clear in an emotional address to parliament two days earlier.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever felt as sad or as angry about the lost decades that we spent bickering and arguing about whether climate change was real or not,” Shaw said on Tuesday. “It is clearly here now, and if we do not act it will get worse.”\nWhat’s made this week’s devastation so shocking is that it came just two weeks after a short, sharp deluge in Auckland, the country’s largest city of 1.7 million people.\nThat downpour caused flash flooding and landslides, and contributed to New Zealand’s wettest month on record — all during what’s typically one of the driest months of the year.\nRiver cities increasingly vulnerable\nNew Zealand owes its stunning landscape partly to the country’s long record of intense rainfall. Rain regularly dumped on its mountains has carved rivers that rage after downpours.\nMany towns and cities sit on their banks — established to take advantage of access to ports and trade routes, which for a long time has served communities well.\n“New Zealand is very good at building communities on floodplains — there’s a large fraction of the population that live close to rivers that tend to flood,” said James Renwick, a weather and climate researcher at Victoria University of Wellington. “There tends to be the attitude that we can build stop banks and that will protect the community, and it does most of the time, until you get a really big event.”\nThose really big events are expected to become more frequent as global temperatures warm. New Zealand lies in the South Pacific Ocean, and is vulnerable to tropical cyclones that typically form in the north but can affect any part of the country in their path. This week, the northeast suffered the biggest hit as Cyclone Gabrielle whipped up winds and days of rain.\nLa Niña, a weather event that results in warmer air and sea temperatures, also contributed to Gabrielle’s strength.\nSam Dean, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA, said climate change is not necessarily going to increase the frequency of tropical cyclones, but it will make them more powerful.\n“They’re occurring over sea surface temperatures that are warmer than they were. The atmosphere is warmer and it’s holding more moisture, so there’s just more fuel, more energy available that makes them more intense, it makes them more damaging,” he said. “It makes the winds a little bit stronger. It makes the rainfall more significant.”\nAnd cyclones like Gabrielle can form and move around just about any part of the country, he said, so the risk isn’t just in one part of the nation. “I don’t think there’s any part of New Zealand that isn’t at risk of extreme rainfall,” he said.\nBut heavy rainfall isn’t the only risk posed by climate change in New Zealand, long considered a safe haven by those seeking refuge from global troubles.\nParts of the country have experienced drought in recent years, and even a few years ago, Auckland — the city hit by a short bout of intense rainfall in January — was close to running out of water.\n“The whole area is usually very dry and very close to drought this time of year. Now it’s soaking wet,” said Daithi Stone, a climate scientist at NIWA. “But that risk of drought hasn’t gone away, (and) in our predictions of how climate change is going to affect New Zealand, that’s a feature that seems to be fairly robust — that Northland (north of Auckland) will get drier.”\nHeat waves could also become a risk in a country that’s not accustomed to unbearably hot temperatures, Stone added.\n“We’re not used to heat waves … over here, it’s a novel concept. And I think we may get a fright sometime in the not too distant future,” he said.\nReducing emissions\nWith just 5 million people, New Zealand is a small player when it comes to global carbon emissions.\nLast year, it produced 78.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent — well below the biggest emitters, China and the United States. But the New Zealand government takes climate change seriously, and last year released its first emissions reductions plan to meet a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also released a national adaptation plan to mitigate climate disasters in the future.\nDean, from NIWA, said Cyclone Gabrielle was likely to prompt an acceleration of that plan. “You can see an urgency to get some of these things in place and I think that’s been motivated, definitely, by this event,” he said.\nRenwick, from Victoria University, said an obvious solution would be to move people away from coastlines and rivers that are at risk of more frequent flooding. But he said communities with long ties to the area will likely be reluctant to leave, and he predicted a greater emphasis on protection than relocation.\n“I suspect the main response is going to be protection works rather than moving people away. So building sea walls, building levees, stop banks, putting houses up on higher piles,” he said.\nDuring his visit to Gisborne, Hipkins said Cyclone Gabrielle had made clear to him that the country needs to improve its climate defenses.\n“There’s no question that as a country we need to look at the resilience of our infrastructure. And we need to do that with a much greater sense of urgency, I think, than we have ever seen before,” he said.\nThat may include spending money to relocate roads subject to repeated flooding, he added.\n“We actually just have to get real about some of the roads and the fact that we’re going to have to move some of those roads to places where they can be more resilient.”\nBut aside from adapting, as a small country, New Zealand is reliant on the biggest emitters doing more to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius — the threshold scientists say is needed to prevent the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization.\n“What we need to see is China and the US, Australia, Canada, Brazil and the big emitters starting to pull their emissions down as well, and I hope we can provide a bit of inspiration, a bit of an example in this country to help other countries do the same,” Renwick said.\n“We really want to stop warming the climate more because these extreme events will become overwhelming.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Opal Lee, the ‘grandmother of Juneteenth,’ becomes second Black American to have portrait hung in Texas statehouse\nBy Justin Gamble, CNN\nOpal Lee, the 96-year-old Texan who successfully championed legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, was honored on Wednesday with the unveiling of a portrait at the state Capitol.\nThe portrait of Lee, known as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” is the first new portrait to be hung in the state Senate chamber in more than 40 years.\n“This is a historic day,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during the unveiling ceremony.\nLee, who walked from Fort Worth to Washington, DC, to advocate for the Juneteenth holiday, received a standing ovation during the ceremony. “This does not happen often, it’s a great honor,” Patrick said.\nThe resolution to honor Lee was presented by State Sen. Royce West who said Lee is “worthy of all the accolades” that have come her way.\nState Sen. Borris Miles said the celebration of Lee is an example of Texas giving people roses while they are alive to receive them. Miles called Lee a “living legend” whose work will be studied and admired for generations.\nLee told CNN she was delighted when she heard she would be honored with a portrait in the statehouse.\n“I was humbled,” Lee said. “I’m hanging in the same chamber with Barbara Jordan. Oh, wow. I didn’t know how to act.”\nLee’s portrait joins the portrait of late Rep. Barbara Jordan to be the only two Black Americans honored in such a manner in the Texas statehouse. Jordan served in the Texas state Senate prior to representing the state in Congress until her death in 1996.\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill making Juneteenth a national holiday in June 2021.\nLee told CNN she plans to continue her activism advocating for issues such as joblessness, homelessness, health care, and climate change but also wants to continue to educate others about Juneteenth and the effects of racism.\nShe said it’s up to the youth to teach people to love and not to hate.\n“I don’t see why the color of your skin seems to make a difference,” Lee said, adding that it’s time for society to “get over” racism.\nSince getting Juneteenth recognized as a federal holiday, Lee has written a children’s book to help educate the youth about Juneteenth and is working on getting funding for a Juneteenth museum in Fort Worth.\n“Everybody has a part to play,” Lee said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "BP CEO resigns after probe reveals undisclosed relationships with colleagues\nBy Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — BP CEO Bernard Looney has resigned after admitting that he had not been âfully transparentâ about âhistorical relationships with colleagues,â according to a statement from the oil giant on Tuesday.\nMurray Auchincloss, the companyâs CFO, will act as CEO on an interim basis.\nâIn May 2022, the Board received and reviewed allegations, with the support of external legal counsel, relating to Mr Looneyâs conduct in respect of personal relationships with company colleagues. The information came from an anonymous source,â the statement said. During that review, Looney disclosed âa small number of historical relationships with colleagues prior to becoming CEO,â but no breach of the companyâs code of conduct was found.\nFurther allegations of a similar nature were received recently, said BP, and the company began an investigation, which is ongoing.\nâMr Looney has today informed the Company that he now accepts that he was not fully transparent in his previous disclosures,â said the statement. âHe did not provide details of all relationships and accepts he was obligated to make more complete disclosure.â\nLooney, 53, served just under four years at the helm of BP (BP) but began work at the London-based oil and gas company in 1991 at the age of 21. Looney spent the entirety of his career with BP and was promoted to chief executive officer in July 2020 where he oversaw efforts to transition into an integrated energy company with a focus on reducing emissions.\nShares of the stock closed 1.3% lower on Tuesday.\nA green transition\nLooney came into the role with big plans to achieve zero net emissions by 2050 and spend billions on renewable power.\nâEngaging companies with the most carbon to cut is vital to meeting climate goals,â wrote Looney in a 2021 CNN opinion piece with Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. âThey need to be part of the transition to lower and no-carbon solutions if there is to be any chance of meeting the promise of the Paris Agreement. More and more companies are looking to play their part, and the worldâs expectations that they will do so are high.â\nUnder his watch, BP became the only major oil company with goals to reduce oil and gas output this decade. Shareholders werenât too happy with the decision, and BP shares fell behind competitors like Shell (SHEL), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).\nRecently, Looney backtracked on some of those goals and increased spending on crude oil and natural gasses.\nBP missed on profit expectations last quarter but increased its dividend by 10% and announced plans to buy back another $1.5 billion in shares. Shares of the stock are up about 12.6% so far this year.\nFrom dairy to oil\nLooney grew up on a small dairy farm near Kenmare, Ireland, and was the first person in his family to attend college. Both of his parents left school by the age of 11.\nâWe had 14 cows and it was pretty much subsistence farming,â he told the Irish Independent newspaper in 2018. He added that he still likes to follow tractor accounts on Instagram.\nLooney went on to study electrical engineering in Dublin and received a degree in business from Stanford.\nHe began as a drilling engineer at BP and was running the companyâs North Sea operations when BPâs Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in $70 billion in penalties for the company and the largest-ever US oil spill.\nLooney spent 60 days working in Houston after the accident, attempting to cap the well and stop the crude oil from spilling into the Gulf. Four million barrels of oil ultimately were able to flow out of the damaged well, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Looney has called the period the most challenging of his career.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

        "story_text": "Cyclone Freddy survivors dig with bare hands for victims as death toll reaches 326\nBy Charles Pensulo, Nimi Princewill and Stephanie Busari, CNN\nTropical Cyclone Freddy has killed at least 326 people after it ripped through southern Malawi, the country’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs told CNN Thursday.\nThe resulting devastation has left survivors trapped and fighting for survival.\nChilobwe, one of the hardest-hit areas, is a township near the city of Blantyre. Located below a hill, the township saw water gushing down from above on Sunday night.\nAuthorities say over 30 people from the area have died and dozens remain missing as search and rescue efforts continue.\nPeople could be seen on Monday using shovels, even bare hands, to search for the people in the rubble.\n‘Everything is gone’\nDorothy Wachepa, 39, was sleeping when she woke up to a deafening noise “resembling the sound of an airplane.”\n“It was around 12 and I heard the sound accompanied by shouting from people upland,” the mother of four told CNN.\nWhat followed was a torrent of muddy water, accompanied by rocks and trees, sliding down the mountain. All her possessions were washed away.\n“Everything is gone. I was doing a small-scale business selling vegetables because my husband died in 2014. I’ve been supporting the children from the little that I have,” she added.\nWachepa said she and her children were lucky to make it out of the house alive.\nA total of nine people, including Wachepa’s neighbor and a number of local children, died in the cyclone-induced rains, she told CNN.\nWachepa is one of dozens of people seeking shelter at a local church. She has been left with only a sheet to cover herself and her children from the windy and cold nights.\n“We’ve received some blankets and plastic sheets today, so hopefully tonight we will manage to sleep,” Wachepa said.\n‘I don’t know what to do now’\nSarah Chinangwa, 25, could not hide her tears as she recounted how six of her loved ones were killed on Sunday night.\n“My brother and his two children were asleep when the water came. I live close to them, and I tried to shout for them to come out,” she said.\n“They came out and stood at a rock which was at a higher place, but moments later they were all washed away,” she said, adding that her own house was destroyed. “I don’t know what to do now.”\nThe Malawi Ministry of Natural Resources and Climate Change said Tuesday that the cyclone was “weakening but will continue to cause torrential rains associated with windy conditions in most parts of Southern Malawi districts.”\n“The threat of heavy flooding and damaging winds remains very high,” the report added.\nZero visibility\nCharles Kalemba, a commissioner for the Department of Disaster Management Affairs agency, told CNN Tuesday that the situation had worsened in southern Malawi.\n“It’s worse today. A number of places are flooding and a number of roads and bridges are cut. Visibility is almost zero. Electricity is off and also network is a problem. It’s becoming more and more dire,” Kalemba said, adding that rescue operations have also been affected by poor weather.\n“It’s tough. We need to use machinery (for rescue operations) but machines cannot go to places where they were supposed to excavate because of the rains,” Kalemba added.\nMalawi’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services warned Monday that “the threat of damaging winds and heavy flooding remains very high.”\nKalemba added that an improvement in weather was expected from Wednesday. “Possibly by tomorrow, the cyclone may have passed. We are hoping to see improvement from tomorrow but today is worse. There are heavy rains and lots of water.”\nIn Mozambique, at least 10 people were killed and 13 injured in the Zambezia province, according to state broadcaster Radio Mozambique, citing the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management.\nThe deadly cyclone has broken records for the longest-lasting storm of its kind after making landfall in Mozambique for a second time, more than two weeks after the first.\nMore than 22,000 people have been displaced by the tropical storm, according to Radio Mozambique.\n“It’s quite likely that number will go up,” Guy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for UNICEF in Mozambique, told CNN Tuesday.\n“The size or the strength of the storm was much higher than the last time … the impact in terms of damage and the impact on people’s lives has been more substantial,” he said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Inside plans for Copenhagen’s divisive artificial storm-absorbing peninsula\nLeah Dolan, CNN\nIn January 2022, a team of developers, architects and environmental consultants began work on a 50-year project that — if completed — will become one of Denmark’s most ambitious and controversial infrastructure schemes to date: A 271-acre man-made peninsula devised to shield its capital, Copenhagen, from rising sea levels.\nReal estate developer By & Havn believes the cape-like design, known as Lynetteholm, is essential for the protection of the port city, highlighting Copenhagen’s history of dangerous storms and severe flooding. “(Climate) predictions are not getting better,” said the firm’s plant manager and harbor master, Hans Vasehus, during a site visit. “We’ve got to — if we can — change.”\nBut the $439 million environmental project has drawn vocal criticism — primarily, and somewhat ironically, from those concerned about the climate.\nThose opposing Lynetteholm worry construction of the peninsula is already damaging habitats and contaminating surrounding waters, poisoning the city’s harbors and disturbing the delicately balanced salinity of the Baltic sea.\nWhen Lynetteholm was approved by a parliamentary vote in June 2021, the decision was met with public outrage, protests and even attempted legal action. Demonstrators from the 16,000-strong “Stop Lynetteholm!” Facebook group arrived outside the Danish parliament holding placards and wearing sheep costumes. In June 2021, climate organization Klimabevægelsen lodged a petition with the European Parliament claiming the Danish government broke EU law by failing to carry out an adequate assessment of Lynetteholm’s environmental impact (the European Commission dismissed the complaint in September).\nAt a ceremony marking the start of construction in January 2022, Copenhagen’s mayor Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, the city’s transport minister Benny Engelbrecht and By & Havn’s CEO Anne Skovbro were surrounded by protesters as they symbolically shoveled Lynetteholm’s first piles of dirt. One protester even lay on the ground during the photocall, according to the local newspaper Copenhagen Post.\nRising sea levels\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts 9 to 12 additional inches of global sea-level rise by 2050, on top of the 8 to 9 inches already it has already risen since the industrial revolution. Research predicts Copenhagen will be one of the regions most affected by rising sea levels — with parts of the city already sitting just a few feet above the sea’s surface.\n“Large parts of Copenhagen and the surrounding areas will be flooded,” said Vasehus. “The metro (subway) will be flooded in the worst cases, and they’ll be out of business for a year. Copenhagen would be hit really hard.”\nWhile there’s not much to see yet, blueprints for Lynetteholm outline a batwing-shaped peninsula with a small western dam shielding the city’s port. An artificial coastline will face out into the Øresund, a strait of water that leads to the Baltic Sea. Instead of the typical concrete sea-wall, landscape architects hope this will be an example of “adaptive design” that can be modified in the future. Just as a naturally occurring beach can buffer and reflect powerful wave energy, designers believe Lynetteholm’s man-made shoreline will absorb and dissipate incoming waves. Architects argue the wide and purposely jagged coastline will be far easier to bolster and even raise, if sea levels exceed forecasts, than extending a wall higher.\n“Instead of going vertically high, we go wide,” said Ole Schrøder, a partner at Tredje Natur, one of the architecture firms involved in the project.\n“If it were a vertical wall, it would become fragile were the sea levels rise on top with waves,” he added. “But here, we can better accumulate the waves with a beach landscape that absorbs them with a more natural approach.”\nLandscape architects meanwhile hope the project’s shoreline — which they have envisaged as a so-called “process landscape,” designed to be developed over time — will promote biodiversity over the next 10 to 30 years through its mixture of flatlands, forestry and beaches.\n“The idea was to somehow respect the original type of nature that was here before we came,” said Schrøder.\n35,000 new homes are scheduled to be built on Lynetteholm’s flatlands, and although the IPCC advises against new developments in “exposed coastal locations,” it does recommend construction projects that prioritize protecting ecosystems. “We’re creating habitats, either naturally or artificially, to create environments for fish, shellfish, seagrass,” said Schrøder. “It’s not a design, it’s designing a process that will evolve over time.”\nThe problems\nCriticisms of the project are multi-faceted, with those opposed to Lynetteholm emphasizing fears the peninsula will become an example of maladaptation (a term used to describe architecture that is built to address climate change but itself causes significant environmental damage).\nIts positioning has already attracted criticism over potential threats to the delicate saline balance of the surrounding waters, which could kill local organisms and wreck habitats. By & Havn was also forced to alter construction plans after protesters argued that dumping the excavated soil in the city’s harbors could pollute the waters and damage wildlife.\n“We cannot exactly tell you what is toxic in the sludge,” said protestor Kathrime Hammich while on a group video call with the Stop Lynetteholm! campaign. “But we know that a part of the project will be built on a place where there have been shipyards in the past, and they have everything from paint to (old ship) parts (buried) in the harbor.” While Vasehus insists removed soil will be “uncontaminated,” he admitted that his firm’s original proposal for disposing of soil was “not in fashion anymore.”\nThe project’s fluid budget is another issue for critics. The initial phase of construction was reportedly expected to cost 300 million Danish krone (approximately $43 million), but By & Havn admits the budget will likely reach more than 10 times that amount. The entire project’s budget now stands at 70 billion DK ($9.9 billion).\nThe young people opposing the project “feel their agency is being taken away,” said Nicholas Woollhead, another member of the protest group. “The plans that are being made bind them to a budget for the next 70 or 100 years,” he added.\n“We decided to live in Copenhagen (because) it’s a nice city to live in,” added fellow protester Marcello Morns. “And somehow now it’s going to be a construction project. It’s going to make Copenhagen noisy and dirty for the rest of my life.”\nNew dawn of climate design\nLynetteholm is not the only project of its kind on Copenhagen’s horizon. In fact, an entire man-made archipelago is set to be built in the harbor in coming years. Also developed with rising sea levels and urban flooding in mind, the project was designed by MAST, an architectural firm currently formulating a prototype of floating pavilion platforms they hope can one day be used to build homes on water.\nThe first islet, named CPH-Ø1 was completed in 2018.\nIt’s more evidence of a new wave of climate-focused architecture beginning to emerge. More and more firms are opting for repurposed materials to mitigate the impact of the environmental emergency, or trialing evolving construction techniques — like MAST — to better adjust to different conditions. Landscape architects, such as those behind Lynetteholm, are increasingly meeting the fluid reality of climate change with adaptive design.\nWhile it seems there is no going back now (Lynetteholm’s first phase of construction is already on-schedule to be completed by early 2023), one of the project’s biggest challenges will be convincing the public. In November, developers By & Havn announced they will be holding citizens meetings with 66 members of the public from Copenhagen and the surrounding area in an attempt to engage with mounting criticism.\n“I still think that parliament and the municipality is in general behind us,” said Vasehus. “There is an audience in Denmark that is against this, sure, there’s a lot of individuals against us, they might have their own ideas. Some of the people living out here do not think this is an attraction, and I can understand that.”\nTop image: Renderings of Lynetteholm courtesy of COWI.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Europe is trying to ditch planes for trains. Here’s how that’s going\nMiquel Ros, CNN\nEver since the “flight shame” movement began encouraging travelers to seek greener alternatives to jet planes, many in Europe have been looking to the continent’s extensive rail network to replace short-haul air travel.\nThere’s definitely been progress, with airlines like Dutch carrier KLM entering into rail partnerships on certain routes and some countries like Austria and more recently France seeking to restrict internal routes where trains are available.\nThat’s amid a palpable rail revolution on mainland Europe, with new high-speed routes and operators coming online, a reversal in the decline of overnight sleeper services, new tunnel links cutting travel times and new locomotives improving reliability and efficiency. In Spain, Germany and Austria, cheap ticket deals have also played their part.\nWith so much railway investment, it seems as if the train-ification of Europe’s air transport network is well underway. Surely, it’s only a matter of time before the continent is relying almost exclusively on its iron roadways for getting around and the skies are clearer and greener .\nIn reality, that remains a distant dream. But why?\nAs with many efforts to innovate away from environmentally harmful practices, there’s good news and bad news. Fixes are being made, but none of them are quick. And there’s no sign that Europe’s airports are going to get quieter anytime soon.\nSymbolic move\nThis year got off to a strong start with new legislation promised in France that would ban short-haul flight on a number of domestic routes to help the country cut levels of planet-heating pollution, but though approved by EU officials, the measures look limited in impact.\nFor the ban to apply, the EU insisted the air route in question must have a high speed rail alternative that makes it possible to travel between the two cities in less than two and a half hours. There must also be enough early and late-running trains to enable travelers to spend at least eight hours at the destination.\nThis means that, as things stand, only three routes are to be culled: those linking Paris-Orly airport to the cities of Bordeaux, Nantes and Lyon.\nIn fact, the ruling by the EU’s European Commission watered down the original French plans, which would have seen a further five routes ending: From Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Bordeaux, Nantes, Lyon and Rennes, as well as a Lyon to Marseilles route.\nThe result, say critics, is something that pays lip service to climate concerns without really doing anything about them.\n“The French flight ban is a symbolic move, but will have very little impact on reducing emissions,” says Jo Dardenne, aviation director at cleaner transport campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E).\nT&E has estimated that the three routes affected by the ban represent only 0.3% of the emissions produced by flights taking off from mainland France, and 3% of the country’s domestic flight emissions (again counting only mainland domestic flights).\nIf the five additional routes that the French authorities wanted to include were added, those figures would be 0.5% and 5% respectively.\nThat doesn’t sound like much. But although aviation as a whole currently accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, its overall contribution to climate change is estimated to be higher, due to the other gases, water vapor and contrails that airplanes emit.\nWhat’s more, it’s a fast-growing industry — despite the pause enforced by Covid — and is on track to be one of the most significant emissions-contributing industries in the future. Aviation emissions in Europe increased an average of 5% year-on-year between 2013 and 2019, according to the EU.\nAirlines pay zero tax or duty on their fuel in the EU, unlike other forms of transport. Plane tickets are also exempt from VAT.\nMore restrictions to come\nOn the positive side, despite its limited impact, the French ruling sets a precedent that will be difficult to ignore by the aviation industry at a time when it’s coming under ever increasing scrutiny from the public, as well as politicians.\n“The French measure is so marginal in its current scope that it is sustainability theater rather than having any material impact on emissions,” says Patrick Edmond, managing director of Altair Advisory, an Ireland-based aviation consultancy.\n“However we can look at it a different way — as the harbinger of more restrictions on aviation which are likely if the industry doesn’t get more serious about decarbonizing itself.”\nFrance isn’t the first European country to take a tough line on super short-haul flights.\nIn 2020 the Austrian government bailed out the national carrier, Austrian Airlines, on the condition that it axed all flights where a rail journey could take less than three hours.\nIn reality, only the Vienna-Salzburg flight route was cut, with train services increased on the line in response. A similarly short route, from Vienna to Linz, had been moved to rail in 2017.\nThat same year, the government also launched a 30 euro ($32) tax on all flights of under 350 kilometers (220 miles) departing from Austrian airports.\nOther European countries are said to be considering curbs on short-haul commercial flights as well — a move that could be welcome, since 62% of European citizens would support a ban on short-haul flights, according to a 2020 survey. Spain has outlined plans to cut flights where train journeys take less than 2.5 hours by 2050.\nNot surprisingly these moves have set alarm bells ringing in the aviation industry.\nAccording to a 2022 report commissioned by the European Regional Airlines Association (ERA) together with a number of other aerospace industry bodies, if all airline traffic on routes of under 500 kilometers (310 miles) switched to another form of public transport, the potential carbon savings would total up to 5% of intra-EU emissions.\n“For many decision-makers, banning short-haul flights and showing support to the rail industry is an easy win to gain favor with the public, especially in Europe,” Montserrat Barriga, the ERA’s director general, told CNN.\nBut Barriga and others — on both side of the issue — point to the double standard of restricting short-haul flights and phasing out carbon allowances for flights in Europe while taking no major steps to limit connections outside the bloc.\nLong-haul flights produce the most emissions globally. A recent academic paper in the Journal of Transport Geography found that while flights of under 500 kilometers (310 miles) account for 27.9% of departures in the EU, they represent only 5.9% of fuel burnt. In contrast, flights longer than 4,000 kilometers make up just 6.2% of departures from the EU, but 47% of fuel burnt.\n“Governments continue ignoring the biggest source of aviation emissions — long-haul flights, that remain unpriced and unregulated,” says T&E’s Dardenne. “Flight bans shouldn’t be used by governments as a distraction from the real problem.”\nObstacles to switching\nAnd while railways are currently blazing fresh trails through Europe, playing a part in the recent collapse of Alitalia, Italy’s national airline, rail operators could do more, says Jon Worth, founder of public advocacy group Trains for Europe.\nHigh prices and low frequencies remain an obstacle to getting more people to switch from flying, he says — especially on trunk routes like Paris to Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Barcelona.\n“On quite a few corridors, rail could get a share of multimodal transportation way above the current one. Rail operators have focused on maximizing profit rather than market share. The latter can only be achieved either by running railways as a public service or by introducing more competition,” he says.\nBetter connectivity between intercity rail and airports would also reduce the need for short-haul flights. Worth adds that it’s essential to offer combined tickets, so that, for example, if a train is delayed and the connection is missed, travelers are accommodated on the next one, as happens now with connecting flights.\nThis works rather well in countries where airlines and operators cooperate, including Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland and Spain. In February 2023, Italian airline ITA Airways — Alitalia’s successor — signed on to work with Italy’s national rail operator to create links, too.\nHowever, this is an area where there is still much to be done — for starters, the schemes above are limited to the national carriers. A proposed piece of legislation called Multimodal Digital Mobility Services is expected to be adopted by the European Commission in 2023 with the aim to facilitate this type of intermodal travel more widely.\nBack in France, shorter train travel times and increased frequencies may mean the end of the line for more domestic air routes when the ban comes up for review — the measure is only valid for three years. However, advances in clean flight technology may eventually change the perspectives for regional aviation as well.\nShort-haul flights are likely to be the first segments of the aviation industry to decarbonize since most of the projects under way in the fields of electric, hybrid-electric and hydrogen-powered aviation focus precisely on small airplanes designed to cover very short distances.\nThe debate looks set to continue playing out over the next few years, as the environmental, social, economic, political and technological parameters that shape this discussion continue to evolve — and as the climate crisis continues.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "GOP-led states sue Biden administration to block ESG investment rule\nBy Matt Egan, CNN\nA coalition of Republican-led states is suing the US Labor Department to block an imminent rule change that will allow 401(k) managers to consider climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments.\nThe coalition, led by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, argues the Labor Department rule violates federal law, would put trillions of dollars of retirement savings at risk and is being driven by political ideology.\nThe lawsuit was filed by 25 states, almost all of them led by a Republican governor. The two states led by Democrats, Kentucky and Louisiana, have Republican attorneys general.\nThe final rule, announced in November, is scheduled to take effect on January 30. The rule was aimed at removing restrictions imposed by the Trump administration by clarifying that retirement account managers can consider climate change and ESG factors when they select investments and exercise shareholder rights such as proxy voting.\n“The Biden administration is promoting its climate change agenda by putting everyday people’s retirement money at risk,” Reyes said in a statement on Thursday. “We are acting with urgency on this case because this illegal rule is set to take effect next week. It must be stopped.”\nThe complaint alleges that the Labor Department ESG rule would “make it easier for fiduciaries to act with mixed motives” and “harder for beneficiaries to police such conduct.”\nThe Labor Department referred questions on the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe 25 states in the lawsuit are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And they flagged that generative AI models can produce flawed results known as âhallucinations.â\nAn impenetrable black box\nAnother worry for regulators is that some AI models operate as âblack boxesâ â meaning their inner workings are impenetrable to outsiders.\nFSOC said this âlack of âexplainabilityâ can make it difficult to assess the systemâs conceptual soundness, increasing uncertainty about their suitability and reliability.â\nIn other words, if banks are relying on mysterious AI models, that makes it hard to understand how sturdy their underlying systems truly are.\nRelatedly, regulators expressed concern about how these AI systems could âproduce and possibly mask biased or inaccurate results.â That in turn would raise worries about fair lending and other consumer protection issues, FSOC said.\nThe move comes just two years after regulators first classified climate change as an âemerging threat to US financial stability.â\nAI investment and adoption has boomed, even as some experts warn of serious dangers with the technology. President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to take steps to safeguard the development of AI, which is a booming area of adoption and investment.\nâErrors and biases can become even more difficult to identify and correct as AI approaches increase in complexity, underscoring the need for vigilance by developers of the technology, the financial sector firms using it, and the regulators overseeing such firms,â FSOC said.\nThe popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, which use large language models to identify patterns in data and create text and images, has only accelerated the interest in AI.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Biden to make first visit to Canada as president later this month\nBy Kevin Liptak, CNN\nPresident Joe Biden will pay his first visit to Canada since taking office later this month for talks with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and an address to the country’s Parliament, the White House announced Thursday.\nTraditionally a stop in the United States’ northern neighbor is customary in the opening months of a presidency. But Covid-19 restrictions and the all-consuming war in Ukraine delayed Biden’s first visit to Ottawa until more than two years into his term.\nThe delay hasn’t appeared to have dampened relations with Trudeau, a fellow liberal who is closely aligned with Biden on many policies. Still, there are some areas of disagreement on trade and immigration that will be hashed out during the visit, set to occur from March 23-24.\nThe White House said first lady Dr. Jill Biden would accompany her husband in Ottawa.\nBiden will “reaffirm the United States’ commitment to the US-Canada partnership and promote our shared security, shared prosperity, and shared values,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote in a statement.\nBiden and Trudeau coordinated recently when a suspected Chinese spy balloon traversed parts of Canada and the United States. Later, US fighter jets shot down other unidentified objects over both countries.\nTrudeau said amid those incidents that he would discuss protecting North American airspace with Biden during his expected visit. The White House said the conversation would revolve around “modernizing the North American Aerospace Defense Command.”\nJean-Pierre said the two men would also discuss Ukraine. Trudeau, the longest-serving leader in the G7, has been an ally to Biden in providing military and financial assistance to the country during Russia’s invasion.\nClimate change, the opioid crisis and supply chain issues are also on the agenda, according to the White House.\nBiden’s predecessor Donald Trump visited Canada only once for a Group of 7 summit held in a wooded resort north of Quebec City. His acrimony toward Trudeau was on display afterward when he rescinded his signature from a joint statement and labeled the Canadian prime minister “very dishonest and weak.”\nBiden, meanwhile, has met Trudeau several times since taking office, including most recently during a North American Leaders Summit in Mexico City in January.\nThe two men have known each other for years. One of Biden’s final trips as vice president was to attend a state dinner held in his honor in Ottawa; during his toast, Biden recounted the call he received from Trudeau’s father, Pierre, — then serving as prime minister himself — when his first wife and daughter died in a car accident.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "5 things to know for Jan. 11: Storms, Ukraine, US military, Airline complaints, Eggs\nBy Alexandra Meeks, CNN\nIn recent months, back-to-back extreme weather events like floods, tornados and hurricanes have caused catastrophic damage across the US — costing at least $165 billion last year alone. Scientists are saying the fingerprints of climate change are all over these weather disasters and underscore the urgency to cut planet-warming emissions.\nHere’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n1. Storms\nAt least 17 people have died in California as a result of the winter storms that have battered the state, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday. From north to south in the Golden State this week, heavy downpours have caused mudslides, sinkholes and desperate rescues. The latest forecasts show more rain is expected to drench Northern California today and Thursday, while Southern California will see a pause in rain until the end of the week. Northern California’s severe weather will also be followed by a weekend storm, meteorologists say, in addition to four more atmospheric river events expected next week. There are also winter storm alerts in effect for five other western states including Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n2. Ukraine\nUkrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the US as soon as next week, according to the Pentagon. The training program will take place at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, where the US conducts its own training on operating and maintaining the advanced air defense system. The US has already trained Ukrainian troops in Europe, but analysts say the decision to conduct Patriot training on American soil could increase tensions with Moscow further as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has constantly warned Western nations against further involvement in the war. About 90 to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are expected to arrive in Oklahoma for the training, the Pentagon said.\n3. US military\nThe US military’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate for troops has been officially rescinded, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a memo Tuesday night. The requirement to remove the mandate was viewed as a win for conservative lawmakers who had argued that it was hindering the military’s recruitment efforts, although Pentagon officials maintained there was no evidence to support the claim. This comes after President Joe Biden recently signed the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring its dismissal. Separately, the US military announced Tuesday that it intercepted a shipment of more than 2,000 Iranian assault rifles destined for Yemen. The move will likely add to the existing tensions between the US and Iran, which have increased in recent months due to the crackdowns on civil unrest throughout the country.\n4. Airline complaints\nAfter Southwest Airlines experienced a meltdown that scuttled holiday travel plans for hundreds of thousands of passengers, federal officials now say they’re acting on “thousands” of complaints from Southwest customers — including complaints that the airline is not making good on its pledge to issue refunds. The Department of Transportation “has sent every complaint directly to Southwest” and is now demanding the airline “provide substantive responses” to each within 60 days. Southwest Airlines told CNN it is processing “tens of thousands” of requests each day and is complying with the department’s regulations. According to a financial filing from Southwest, the meltdown cost the airline between $725 million and $825 million in lost revenue, additional crew costs, and passenger refunds.\n5. Egg shortage\nSeveral grocery items are getting more expensive, but nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices. The price increases are linked to a deadly avian flu that has been a problem in the US for several months now, causing widespread shortages. Specifically, the bird flu has been reducing poultry flocks — but the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket. This year, US egg supplies will “remain constrained” through the first quarter, though flocks are expected to start repopulating faster as bird flu risks are contained, according to a new report. However, scientists say the egg shortage in other countries like Japan may not improve anytime soon as circulation of the virus has reached an all-time high.\nTHIS JUST IN\nSeveral people injured in suspected Paris knife attack\nAt least six people were injured in an attack at Paris’ Gare Du Nord central railway station early this morning, French authorities said.

        "story_text": "Britain approves huge, controversial oil and gas field in the North Sea\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\n(CNN) — The British government approved the development of a huge oil and gas field in the North Sea Wednesday, sealing its commitment to keep producing fossil fuels for decades to come.\nThe Rosebank field, situated northwest of Shetland in Scotland and majority-owned by Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, is the largest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea, with the potential to produce 500 million barrels of oil.\nIts development has sparked fierce criticism for the impacts it will have on the climate crisis and the UKâs ability to meet its pledge to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.\nâWe have today approved the Rosebank Field Development Plan which allows the owners to proceed with their project,â said a spokesperson for oil and gas regulator the North Sea Transition Authority in a statement.\nThe spokesperson added the decision had been made âtaking net zero considerations into account throughout the projectâs lifecycle.â Net zero is where the world removes at least as much planet-heating pollution as it emits.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently said he wanted to âmax outâ oil and gas developments in the North Sea and issue hundreds of new licenses. Sunak has argued that these reserves will give the UK energy security and help lower bills.\nâEven when weâve reached net zero in 2050, a quarter of our energy needs will come from oil and gas. But there are those who would rather that it come from hostile states than from supplies we have here at home,â Sunak said in a statement in July.\nBut critics argue that the UK exports 80% of its oil.\nâRosebank will do nothing to lower fuel bills or boost UK energy security. Most of this oil will be shipped abroad and then sold back to us at whatever price makes the oil and gas industry the most profit,â said Tessa Khan, executive director of UK campaigning organization Uplift and a climate lawyer.\nClimate groups also say that continuing to produce new fossil fuels decades into the future threatens the UKâs climate commitments.\nThe International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there could be no new oil and gas fields if the world wants to have a good chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nLyndsay Walsh, climate change policy adviser at Oxfam, said Rosebank locks the UK âfurther into fossil fuel dependency and increasing emissions as record-shattering heatwaves, floods and wildfires destroy lives.â\nAn analysis from Uplift found that the planet-heating pollution produced by Rosebank would be enough to push the UK beyond its climate targets from 2028 onwards.\nClaire Coutinho, the UKâs minister for energy security and net zero, said Rosebank will bring jobs and enable the UK to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports.\nâWe are a world leader at reducing carbon emissions but as much as we will be ambitious, we must be pragmatic,â she posted on X (formerly Twitter) Wednesday.\nRosebank is about twice the size of the controversial Cambo oil field, also in the North Sea, which was on course to be developed until Shell pulled out of the project in 2021, citing economic reasons.\nUplift has said it will launch legal action against the government to challenge the Rosebank decision.\nThe approval comes just a week after Sunak announced a delay of key climate commitments, including pushing back a ban on the sale of gasoline and diesel-powered cars and slowing plans to phase out gas boilers. Climate experts say those decisions will also make it much harder for the UK to meet its net zero commitments.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "Why an Arab nation has opted to teach the Holocaust in its schools\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary, CNN\nThe United Arab Emirates will soon become the first Arab nation to teach the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in its schools, a historic move that has been praised in some quarters — but also criticized in others.\nThe UAE plans to include Holocaust education in the curriculum for primary and secondary schools, the country’s embassy in the United States tweeted last week.\nThe UAE says it will work with the Tel Aviv- and London-based Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, and Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem to help build a new curriculum, according to a report in the Times of Israel.\n“Now we have the opportunity to reach new audiences and Yad Vashem is working on paving the way to bring Holocaust awareness to the Arab-speaking world,” the organization’s spokesperson Simmy Allen told CNN. “Across most of the Arab-speaking world, until recently, there was little to no dialogue with Yad Vashem about the events and atrocities of the Holocaust,” he added.\nThe teaching of the Holocaust has been largely absent from governments’ school curricula in Arab countries, but the UAE has been doubling down on Holocaust awareness since normalizing relations with Israel in 2020 in a pact known as the Abraham Accords.\nUAE Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed visited Berlin’s main Holocaust memorial in late 2020 with his Israeli counterpart. In 2021, the first Holocaust memorial exhibition in the Arab region opened in Dubai, and last year, the foreign minister made a highly publicized visit to Yad Vashem, where he laid a wreath.\nIn an article published in Israel’s Jerusalem Post in 2021, Ali Al Nuaimi, chairman of the Defense Affairs, Interior and Foreign Relations Committee of the UAE’s Federal National Council for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, wrote that school curricula in the Arab world “have omitted critical parts of history in the West,” including the Holocaust, for too long. Muslims, he argued, “must liberate themselves from the burdens of history to move ahead toward the future.”\nThe move is “a natural outgrowth of the Abraham Accords,” Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told CNN.\n“The UAE leadership has been engineering cultural change to support its strategic objectives,” she said. “Embracing ethnic diversity has accompanied the expansion of a global workforce, and interfaith dialogue has aided in countering pan-Islamism and religious extremism.”\nIt isn’t clear whether the UAE’s move will apply only to government-run schools or the hundreds of private schools in the country. The UAE’s ministry of education didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment by the time of publication.\nApproximately 90% of the UAE’s population of about 10 million is made up of expatriates according to World Bank data, many of whom send their children to privately run schools that teach international curricula that often include Holocaust education.\nEmiratis on social media were largely silent about the decision to teach the Holocaust, but Abdul Khaleq Abdulla, a prominent UAE commentator and political science professor, commented on the announcement in a tweet, saying there was no need for it.\n“There has been repeated talk about adding the topic of the Holocaust to our school curricula, despite the absence of any national value, educational (benefit), and knowledge need for (it)” he tweeted.\nMuch of the reaction from Arabs outside the UAE was critical, with some accusing the country of handing over control of its syllabus to Israel, while others questioned whether it would come at the expense of teaching the history of the Palestinians, particularly the Nakba. The Nakba, which means catastrophe in Arabic, refers to the establishment of Israel in 1948, which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians forced to leave their homes.\n“We don’t deny the Holocaust and we sympathize with its victims,” tweeted Dareen, a commenter on Twitter who identifies as Palestinian. “But including it in the curriculum for young students makes it easier for the occupation (Israel) to infiltrate the Arab people.”\nThe UAE, which has a sizable Palestinian community, has said in local media reports that its normalization with Israel would not affect its commitment to the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nYasser Abu Hilala, a former managing director at Al Jazeera, tweeted that teaching the Holocaust in the UAE was “useful for knowing the history and brutality of the West,” adding that “it is the same West from which Zionism spawned,” referring to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East.\nThe involvement of an Israeli organization in writing the country’s syllabus brings an added layer of complexity. Polls have shown that the public in the Arab nations that have normalized relations don’t share their governments’ view in their embrace of Israel. A survey by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in July 2022 shows that more than 70% in the UAE and Bahrain hold a negative view of normalization.\nThe Abraham Accords are also unpopular in other Arab nations. An opinion poll by the Qatar-based Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies released last week showed that only 7.5% of Arabs supported normalization, with 84% considering Israel to be the greatest threat to the Arab region, followed by the United States and Iran respectively.\nThe poll, which surveyed more than 33,000 people in 14 Arab nations, didn’t include the UAE.\nAnalysts say that despite the gap between official and popular views on Israel, the UAE is likely to move forward with strengthening ties with Israel.\n“The Emirati public might not be entirely on board, but the leadership has decided this is the path they will pursue and so they will continue to do so,” Dina Esfandiary, senior adviser for Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group, told CNN. “They believe that they have greater influence over Israel and Israeli action by maintaining these good ties.”\nSome Emiratis will be uncomfortable with coordination with an Israeli institution “in a sensitive area like education” since there is popular sympathy with the plight of the Palestinians, said Diwan of the Arab Gulf States Institute.\n“But this should not negate the value and importance of understanding the historical facts and context of the Holocaust,” she added. “Disinformation is a problem and serves no one.”\nWith additional reporting by Michael Schwartz in Jerusalem\nThe digest\nThree Palestinians killed in Israeli raids amid violent start to 2023\nThree Palestinian men were killed in separate Israeli raids into the West Bank on Thursday, bringing the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces to nine in the first 12 days of the year, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israeli forces came under fire in one of the raids, the Palestinian ministry and the Israeli military said.\n- Background: The nine Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank this year include three teens aged 14, 16 and 17, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The total also includes a Palestinian man who had stabbed an Israeli civilian in the West Bank on Wednesday, according to the Israeli military.\n- Why it matters: Last year was the deadliest for both Israelis and West Bank Palestinians in nearly two decades, official statistics from the two sides showed. Tensions have been high since Israel swore in its most right-wing government to date last month.\nUAE appoints oil boss as president of climate conference, alarming activists\nThe UAE appointed the head of one of the world’s largest oil producers to preside over the UN’s COP28 climate summit, in a move activists warned could undermine this year’s global conference. Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, will oversee COP28, which takes place from November 30 in Dubai. The UAE has however touted his climate credentials, including his position as the country’s climate change envoy and role as founder of the renewable energy company Masdar.\n- Background: Political leaders and representatives from more than 190 countries will congregate to discuss how to put the world on course to meet the Paris Climate Agreement ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n- Why it matters: The appointment has caused a backlash among some climate groups, given the role fossil fuels play in driving climate change. Climate organizations have said it would undermine the possibility of achieving climate pledges and some have called for Al Jaber to relinquish his oil industry job to take this post.\nIran sentences former high-ranking defense official to death for spying\nAlireza Akbari, a former Iranian deputy defense minister who is also a British citizen, was sentenced to death for spying for the United Kingdom, Iranian judiciary-affiliated outlet Mizan said on Wednesday.\n- Background: Mizan reported that Akbari appealed the decision, and after reviewing the case, Iran’s Supreme Court upheld the death sentence. Iran’s intelligence ministry said it had confirmed that Akbari was an undercover agent for the British intelligence service MI6, adding that he collected “important national information and provided it in a fully aware and informed manner.”\n- Why it matters: Relations between the UK and Iran have deteriorated significantly due to the Islamic Republic’s crackdown on anti-government protests there. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly tweeted saying that the sentencing is “politically motivated.”\nAround the region\nThe popular American music festival Coachella will feature Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna in this year’s lineup, making her the first artist to perform in Arabic in the festival’s history.\nTaking place in California in April, Coachella draws hundreds of thousands of visitors every year and features some of the biggest names in music.\n“I’m so proud and excited to bring my culture and music to Coachella” wrote the singer in an Instagram post.\nFans were ecstatic to hear the news, with one user on Twitter writing “ELYANNA AT COACHELLA THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”\n“Makes me want to go to @coachella for the first time!” tweeted another user.\nElyanna’s rise to fame came after her first EP “Elyanna” in 2020.\nShe describes her music as having a genre of its own “Yes, I have the Arabic lyrics but at the same time it’s not so Arabic, [and] not so American,” she told GQ magazine. “It’s in-between and I want to keep that happening… it gets everybody to listen.”\nWith millions of streams on music platform Spotify, Elyanna’s music blends instruments and Palestinian melodies, as well as those from elsewhere in the Middle East, Latin America and the United States.\nWhile Elyanna will be the first singer to perform in the Arabic language at Coachella, she is not the first Arab performer.\nPalestinian DJ Sama AbdulHadi performed a set at last year’s festival and is credited with introducing the techno scene in her home country. Besides Coachella, AbdulHadi also performed across the US, Europe, and the Middle East.\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary\nPhoto of the day\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Elon Muskâs X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account\nCNN\nBy Clare Duffy, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — A day after Elon Musk restored the X accounts of notorious right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website, Infowars, the platform is actively promoting Jonesâ account to other users, giving the fringe figure a major platform to air his deceptive and dangerous views.\nConspiratorial posts fromÂ Jonesâ account appeared Monday in the âFor Youâ feed of some users who do not follow himÂ on X; his account was promoted in some usersâÂ âWho to Followâ recommendations; and his name was promoted in Xâs top trending topics section.\nMusk on Sunday also elevated Jonesâ newly restored profile, which had 1.6 million followers as of Monday,Â by engaging with him in a live streamedÂ interview on X. They were joined byÂ Andrew Tate, the self-proclaimed misogynistic internet personality who earlier this year wasÂ indicted on human traffickingÂ and rape charges in Romania although he denies the claims,Â far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec,Â âproud Islamophobeâ Laura LoomerÂ and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\nMuskâs promotion of Jones is just the latest example of how theÂ social media platform formerly known as TwitterÂ and its billionaire owner are increasingly elevating fringe, extreme and potentially harmful viewpoints. Since Musk took over the platform last year, he has also restored the accounts of other controversial figures, including prominent election deniers and far-right and neo-Nazi figures.\nJones is perhaps best known for spreading false conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in which 20 children and six adults died nearly 11 years ago. After Jonesâ continuous airing of false claims about Sandy Hook, victimsâ families said they were threatened and harassed by people who followed Jones. A jury last year decided Jones should pay nearly $1 billion in damages to victimsâ families in a defamation case brought against him for his lies about the shooting.\nDuring the Sunday conversation, listened to by millions of users, Musk allowed Jones to lie about his harassment of the families of Sandy Hook victims, with Jones falsely claiming he was just asking questions about the Sandy Hook massacre. The conversation also peddled conspiracy theories on a range of topics, including climate change, âglobalists,â and government censorship.\nThe Jones and Infowars accounts will be subject to Xâs policies, and the platform will not monetize the accounts by running ads on them, according to a message from X to its advertising customers that was provided to CNN by Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch.\nBut X has been haphazard at best at enforcement of its own rules since Musk bought the company more than a year ago. The Anti-Defamation League and other online watchdog groups reported last year that hate speech has surged on X in the wake of Muskâs takeover. Xâs policies prohibit hateful conduct, including direct attacks on others âon the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.â (Musk and X have pushed back on claims of rising hate speech on the platform and Musk threatened to sue the ADL for defamation, a threat he later backed off on.)\nJones, who was banned from the platform in 2018 for repeatedly violatingÂ itsÂ abusive behavior policies, is not only known for his false claims about Sandy Hook. He alsoÂ promoted and pushed people to attendÂ the January 6, 2021, rally in Washington D.C. that turned into an attack on the US Capitol and helpedÂ to bring to prominence Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy in connection with the riot. On January 6, Jones led a march down Pennsylvania Avenue and up the steps of the Capitol; Jones has not been charged with any crimes related to theÂ attack, but among those charged were several so-called âInfowarriors,â from staff members to apparentÂ fans of the site.\nJonesâ return comes as X was already facing an advertiser exodus over concerns about brand safety and hate speech, prompted by Musk himself endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory in November. Musk apologized days later for the post amid a storm of backlash, but he has also promoted the dangerous 2016 âPizzagateâ conspiracy theory and told brands who have left the platform to âgo f**k yourselfâÂ in an interview last month.\nWhen Musk acquiredÂ the platform, then known as Twitter, last fall, he said he would not restore Jonesâ account because of his false claims about Sandy Hook. But Musk appears to have been swayed by a recent right-wing pressure campaign to restore Jones. Musk on SaturdayÂ posted an unscientific poll to his followers that ended with 70% of the nearly 2Â million respondents voting to restore the conspiracy theorist, before restoring Jonesâ account on Sunday.\nIn Sundayâs livestream interview on X, Musk allowed Jones to lie about his harassment of the families of Sandy Hook victims.\nChris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said in a post SundayÂ on X that, âJones is a con artist. So, he will target the innocent. HeâllÂ tell his audience to fear them. Once his audience is scared, heâllÂ squeeze them for $. Everybody suffers except Jones.

        "story_text": "Climate change is impacting the home insurance industry and damaging the housing market\nBy Anna Bahney, CNN\nWashington, DC (CNN) — When Michael Monaghan, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Sellers Realty in northern California, got an offer for a home in Bayside at the sellerâs $650,000 list price in September, he told the buyerâs agent that the buyer needed to start looking for insurance immediately.\nâI said, âStart working on this on day one,ââ Monaghan said. âGetting insurance is the most important thing right now when youâre in escrow for the deal to close.â\nIn the past, acquiring homeownersâ insurance didnât present buyers much difficulty, but as climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather, insurers âÂ especially those in areas most impacted by floods and fires â are raising their premiums, or pulling out altogether, impacting the affordability and availability ofÂ home and fire insurance.\nFor example, in May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in the state, announced it would pause issuing policies in California, citing wildfire risks. That came after Allstate stopped issuing policies in the state. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida and pulled out of the market there entirely.\nâWith many carriers pulling out, that leaves other companies underwriting these really expensive policies,â said Monaghan. âPolicies that cost $10,000 for a year? That is impossible for some buyers who have to pay that all at once [along] with their closing costs.â\nTo help a deal close, Monaghan saidÂ some motivated sellers have given two yearsâ worth of insurance costs to the buyer.\nBut even if a buyer can pay their insurance costs up front (or even has them paid by the seller), buyers still have backed out of deals, worried that their insurance premiums will go up in the years to come.\nHe said buyers wonder, âWill [they] be able to afford it next year? Will their policy be canceled? Then, if they canât get another insurer, their loan gets called. It is a never-ending death spiral.â\nAs the closing day came for his clientsâ home in Bayside, it became clear the buyers had not secured insurance. Monaghan began calling around to help. The most affordable option he could find was $6,348 for the year. The average cost for homeownersâ insurance in the United States is about $1,820, according to an analysis by NerdWallet, but there are many variables.\nUltimately, the buyers walked away. The costly policy and the potential of rising insurance costs in years to come killed the deal.\nNow, the home is back on the market. But with insurance coverage so hard to find, itâs listed for $25,000 less.\nâIt is a very bad situation,â said Monaghan. âWhat insurers say goes. Even if they have flawed maps or are relying on third-party information. They think it is going to get a lot worse over time.â\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number and severity of storms are already getting worse.\nAs of October 10, there have been 24 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion in the United States this year, according to NOAA. TheseÂ included a drought, two floods, 18 severe storms, one tropical cyclone, one wildfire, and one winter storm. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 373 people and had significant economic effects.\nBy comparison, between 1980 and 2022, the typical annual average for events like this was eight. For the most recent five years, the annual average has been 18 events.\nAs climate risks continue, a standoff has developed over who should pay the cost of insuring homes against ever-growing risks.\nHome insurance woes are becoming even more widespread\nAs insurance becomes scarce in some areas and its cost surges, homebuyers are walking away from deals more often than in the past, said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a personal insurance consumer advocacy group based in San Francisco.\nAlthough, she added,Â this is where the industry has been heading for some time now.\nâFlorida and Louisiana have been having extreme property insurance drama for a while, starting from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, then Hurricane Katrina in 2005,â Bach said. âThe severity of the storms and the price tag of the repairs started to get insurersâ attention.â\nBach said that in places like Louisiana, insurers were shown the large-scale risk mitigations put in place in the face of more frequent and harsher storms, such as stronger levees.\nâBut I donât think they are there yet,â she said. âInsurers are not yet accepting the value of risk reduction. They arenât able to reduce prices, they arenât willing to have it impact their underwriting. That is where the heart of the fight lies now.â\nIn the meantime, she said, on top of climate change, other issues are also pushing the risk and cost even higher.\nâThis isnât just climate change, it is climate-change-plus,â Bach said. It is climate change, plus the Covid hangover pushing costs up, plus inflation, plus technology that allows insurers to evaluate risks in a wider array of ways.\nHer organization, whose main focus was once helping those impacted by disaster to recover money from insurance companies, is now primarily devoted to working on insurance availability and affordability issues.\nâIt has evolved from a very regional crisis impacting few areas to a much bigger crisis,â said Bach. âWe didnât want to use the word âcrisis,â but if you talk to the homeowners in WUI [wildland urban interface] areas they would say it is a crisis.â\nStill, Bach said, it is important to keep the crisis in perspective. In California, for example, the share of homeowners using FAIR plan â the insurer of last resort made up of a syndicated fire insurance pool comprised of all insurers licensed to issue property and casualty in the state â remains under 5%, according to the California Department of Insurance.\nCompetition isnât coming to save the day\nWhile insurers have always dropped out of markets or changed their conditions in reaction to a policy, Bach said a competitor would always move in.\nâCompetition would, in fact, heal the wound,â she said. âBut that isnât happening now.â\nâWe are in a world in which natural disasters are more common and more severe, and we are in a state with diverse housing,â said Jennifer Branchini, a Compass agent in Pleasanton and president of the California Association of Realtors.\nâIt is this insurance expense that everyone is now concerned about. Yes, it is expensive to rebuild. What is that doing to the market when it is being put on the homeowner or the person who would like to purchase the house?â\nIn a recent survey of CAR members, only 7% of agents said they had deals fall through. But of those, a whopping 61% said the deal fell through because insurance was not available to the client. An additional 19% fell through because the premium was too expensive.\nAnd it isnât just the lower- or mid-priced homes.\nBranchini heard from a California agent who represented a buyer in the purchase of an $8.2 million property.\nâThe only insurance they could get was through State Farm for $210,000 a year,â she said. âThree days later, State Farm paused new coverage. They lost that insurance. That buyer walked away.â\nThe affordability and availability of insuranceÂ is one more thing in the perfect storm of the current rough housing market, said Branchini.\nâBuyers are facing high interest rates,â she said. âThere is already a lack of availability and lack of affordability. And for many of the properties that are on the market you canât obtain insurance? Or it is very unaffordable insurance?â\nShe remains hopeful that competition and creativity will help the housing market.\nâWeâll have to see some creative solutions in the near term to create that competitive marketplace for insurance,â she said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "The Doomsday Clock reveals how close we are to total annihilation\nBy Megan Marples, Kristen Rogers and Rachel Ramirez, CNN\nThe Doomsday Clock has been ticking for 76 years. But it’s no ordinary clock.\nIt attempts to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world.\nOn Tuesday, the clock was set at 90 seconds until midnight — the closest to the hour it has ever been, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which created the clock in 1947. Midnight represents the moment at which we will have made Earth uninhabitable for humanity. From 2020 to 2022, the clock was set at 100 seconds to midnight.\nThe clock isn’t designed to definitively measure existential threats, but rather to spark conversations about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin.\nThe decision to move the clock 10 seconds forward this year is largely due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the increased risk of nuclear escalation, the Bulletin said in a news release. The continuing threats posed by the climate crisis, as well as the breakdown of norms and institutions needed to reduce risks associated with biological threats like Covid-19, also played a role.\n“We are living in a time of unprecedented danger, and the Doomsday Clock time reflects that reality,” Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin, said in the release. “It’s a decision our experts do not take lightly. The US government, its NATO allies and Ukraine have a multitude of channels for dialogue; we urge leaders to explore all of them to their fullest ability to turn back the Clock.”\nWhat is the Doomsday Clock?\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded by a group of atomic scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, the code name for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.\nOriginally, the organization was conceived to measure nuclear threats, but in 2007 the Bulletin made the decision to include climate change in its calculations.\nOver the last three-quarters of a century, the clock’s time has changed according to how close the scientists believe the human race is to total destruction. Some years the time changes, and some years it doesn’t.\nThe Doomsday Clock is set every year by the experts on the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 11 Nobel laureates.\nAlthough the clock has been an effective wake-up call when it comes to reminding people about the cascading crises the planet is facing, some have questioned the 75-year-old clock’s usefulness.\n“It’s an imperfect metaphor,” Michael E. Mann, Presidential Distinguished Professor in the Earth and environmental science department at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN in 2022, highlighting that the clock’s framing combines different types of risk that have different characteristics and occur in different timescales. Still, he adds it “remains an important rhetorical device that reminds us, year after year, of the tenuousness of our current existence on this planet.”\nEvery model has constraints, Eryn MacDonald, analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Global Security Program, told CNN in 2022, adding that the Bulletin has made thoughtful decisions each year on how to get the people’s attention about existential threats and the required action.\n“While I wish we could go back to talking about minutes to midnight instead of seconds, unfortunately that no longer reflects reality,” she said.\nWhat happens if the clock reaches midnight?\nThe clock has never reached midnight, and Bronson hopes it never will.\n“When the clock is at midnight, that means there’s been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that’s wiped out humanity,” she said. “We never really want to get there and we won’t know it when we do.”\nHow accurate is the clock?\nThe clock’s time isn’t meant to measure threats, but rather to spark conversation and encourage public engagement in scientific topics like climate change and nuclear disarmament.\nIf the clock is able to do that, then Bronson views it as a success.\nWhen a new time is set on the clock, people listen, she said. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, UK, in 2021, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Doomsday Clock when talking about the climate crisis the world is facing, Bronson noted.\nBronson said she hopes people will discuss whether they agree with the Bulletin’s decision and have fruitful talks about what the driving forces of the change are.\nMoving the clock back with bold, concrete actions is still possible. In fact, the hand moved the farthest away from midnight — a whopping 17 minutes before the hour — in 1991, when then President George H.W. Bush’s administration signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Soviet Union. In 2016, the clock was at three minutes before midnight as a result of the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accord.\nWhat can an individual do to turn back time on the clock?\n“We at the Bulletin believe that because humans created these threats, we can reduce them,” Bronson said. “But doing so is not easy, nor has it ever been. And it requires serious work and global engagement at all levels of society.”\nDon’t underestimate the power of talking about these important issues with your peers, Bronson said.\n“You might not feel it because you’re not doing anything, but we know that public engagement moves (a) leader to do things,” she said.\nTo make a positive impact on climate change, look at your daily habits and see if there are small changes you can make in your life such as how often you walk versus drive and how your home is heated, Bronson explained.\nEating seasonally and locally, reducing food waste, and recycling properly are other ways to help mitigate, or deal with the effects of, the climate crisis.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "‘Endless, brutal heat’: Argentina’s late-season heatwave has ‘no similarities in history’\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nArgentina is grappling with an unprecedented late-summer heatwave as temperatures soar to record-breaking levels — causing crops to wither, helping wildfires spread and adding huge pressure to a country already facing an economic crisis.\nThe country’s summer, which technically runs from December to February, was by far the hottest on record, according to Maximiliano Herrara, a climatologist who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe.\nAnd, so far, March has offered no relief.\nTemperatures during the first 10 days of March were 8 to 10 degrees Celsius (14 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal in east-central Argentina, according to the country’s National Meteorological Service.\nThese temperature anomalies, which have persisted over huge areas, are unprecedented, Herrara told CNN. “There is nothing similar that has ever happened in climatic history in Argentina at this scale.”\nHerrara said he had expected a “scorching summer” in Argentina due to the impacts of La Niña, a climate pattern which tends to bring hotter, drier summers to the region. But what has happened shocked him, he said.\n“The length — five months — and intensity of this endless, brutal heat went beyond what I had imagined,” Herrara said.\nRecords have been beaten time and time again.\nBuenos Aires has seen highs above 30 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) every day since February 28. Multiple other locations across the country saw their highest temperatures in the last 63 years during March.\nIn key agricultural provinces of Córdoba, Santa Fe and Northern Buenos Aires, the heat has been “catastrophic” for corn and soybean crops, Mickaël Attia, crop analyst for EarthDaily Analytics, told CNN.\n“The worst drought of the last 30 years in Argentina will have an enormous impact on national corn and soybean production, which is expected to be at least 20-30% lower than last year,” he said.\nWheat is also affected. Exports are projected to fall 28% in 2023 compared to last year, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\nFarmers are facing loses of around $14 billion, Julio Calzada, head of economic research at the Rosario Grains Exchange, told Reuters.\nThere are fears that the agricultural crisis will exacerbate the country’s economic problems. Figures released this week showed yearly inflation topped 100% for the first time in three decades — one of the highest inflation rates in the world.\nThe heat-stricken country is also grappling with wildfires. More than 100,000 hectares (nearly 250,000 acres) have been burned this year in northeast Argentina, according to an AFP report.\nWhile Argentina’s brutal heatwave has been driven by La Niña, which has just ended after three consecutive years, some scientists have pointed to the role the climate crisis plays in intensifying these events.\nA February report from the World Weather Attribution initiative found that while climate change was not the main driver of low rainfall in central South America, it was causing higher temperatures in the region, likely reducing water availability and making the drought more severe.\nAnother WWA report in December found that record temperatures in Argentina and other South American countries late last year were made 60 times more likely by human-caused climate change.\nHerrera cautioned against blaming individual extreme weather events on the climate crisis, but, he said, “generally speaking it’s true that climate change, by fueling more energy to the atmosphere and the oceans, might be responsible for bigger contrasts which in turn worsen such extreme events.”\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, scientists say heatwaves will only become more common.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Jamie Dimon says to be prepared for recession\nBy Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning to Wall Street on Wednesday: Inflation could rise further and recession is not off the table.\nâA lot of things out there are dangerous and inflationary. Be prepared,â he said at the 2023 New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. âInterest rates may go up and that might lead to recession.â\nGovernments across the globe need more money, he said, to fund the green economy, remilitarize and to address energy crises â and that will all be inflationary.\nâIâm cautious about the economy,â he said. The labor market in the United States has been resilient, but âinflation is hurting people.â\nStimulus money handed out during Covid shutdowns and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve had injected âdrugs directly into our systemâ and caused an economic âsugar high,â said Dimon. But thatâs fading. âI think quantitative easing and tightening and these geopolitical issues can bite,â he said.\nIn previous interviews, Dimon has said that the Fed may be far from finished with its aggressive regimen of interest rate hikes in the fight against elevated inflation, and that itâs possible the central bank will continue hiking rates by another 1.5 percentage points, to 7%.\nGeopolitical woes\nDimon stressed that this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades and that the wars in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza could have far-reaching impacts on energy and food supply, trade and geopolitical relationships. It could even, he said, lead to ânuclear blackmail.â\nMankind faces huge risks, he said. One is obviously war in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. But beyond that, Dimon is worried about nuclear proliferation, climate change and the risk of another pandemic.\nThe United States, he said, needs to make sure it has âthe best military in the world, bar none.â Itâs an expensive task, he said, but the stakes are high, âThis is about keeping the Western world together,â he said at the DealBook Summit. âWe need American leadership to make sure this all stays together. I donât want a book written in 50 years about how the West lost.â\nBusiness in China\nJPMorgan Chase does business with TikTokâs parent company ByteDance and is partially underwriting the planned IPO of Chinese fast-fashion company Shein, according to a recent report from Reuters.\nDimon said on Wednesday that heâll follow the lead of the US government when it comes to doing business in China but that he believes companies like Shein do not present a threat to US national security.\nWhile some US lawmakers have said that TikTok is a national security threat, Dimon countered that JPMorgan Chase does due diligence on all of its clients.\nâIâm not afraid of China,â he said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Thousands protest in Germany against coal mine expansion\nBy PHILIPP JENNE\nAssociated Press\nERKELENZ, Germany (AP) — Thousands of people demonstrated in persistent rain on Saturday to protest the clearance and demolition of a village in western Germany that is due to make way for the expansion of a coal mine. There were standoffs with police as some protesters tried to reach the edge of the mine and the village itself.\nSwedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg joined the demonstrators as they protested the clearance of Luetzerath, walking through the nearby village of Keyenberg and past muddy fields. Protesters chanted “Every village stays” and “You are not alone.”\nOrganizers said about 35,000 people took part, while police put the figure at up to 10,000. On the sidelines of the protest, police said people broke through their barriers and some got into the Garzweiler coal mine.\nSome who tried to get to the edge of the mine were pushed back. And German news agency dpa reported that police used water cannons and batons just outside Luetzerath itself, which is now fenced off, against hundreds of people who got that far.\nSome protesters have complained of what they say was undue force by police and about the size of the police response this week. Police, meanwhile, said some demonstrators had thrown fireworks at officers.\nThunberg said the fate of Luetzerath and the expansion of the mine matters far beyond Germany.\nIn the global fight against climate change, “what everyone does matters,” she told The Associated Press shortly before the protest. “And if one of the largest polluters, like Germany, and one of the biggest historical emitters of CO2 is doing something like this, then of course it affects more or less everyone — especially those most bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.”\nAs the demonstration took place, the clearance of Luetzerath was well advanced.\nThe operation to evict climate activists holed up in the village kicked off on Wednesday morning. In the first three days of the operation, police said that about 470 people had left the site, 320 of them voluntarily.\nThey said on Friday afternoon that there were no longer any activists in the remaining buildings or on their roofs. They said Saturday they still had to tackle 15 “structures” such as tree houses and were trying to get into a tunnel in which two people were believed to be holed up, dpa reported. Work to demolish buildings was already underway.\nLuetzerath has become a cause celebre for critics of Germany’s climate efforts.\nEnvironmentalists say bulldozing the village to expand the Garzweiler mine would result in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. The government and utility company RWE argue the coal is needed to ensure Germany’s energy security.\nThe regional and national governments, both of which include the environmentalist Green party, reached a deal with RWE last year allowing it to destroy the abandoned village in return for ending coal use by 2030, rather than 2038.\nSpeakers at Saturday’s demonstration assailed the Greens, whose leaders argue that the deal fulfills many of the environmentalists’ demands and saved five other villages from demolition.\n“It’s very weird to see the German government, including the Green party, make deals and compromise with companies like RWE, with fossil fuel companies, when they should rather be held accountable for all the damage and destruction they have caused,” Thunberg said.\n“My message to the German government is that they should stop what’s happening here immediately, stop the destruction, and ensure climate justice for everyone.”",

        "story_text": "Big money coming to Colorado to fight climate change and create jobs\nBy ALAN GIONET\nClick here for updates on this story\nCOLORADO (KCNC) — Colorado is going to be getting $13.2 billion in incentive money to spawn the growth of the clean energy industry and reduce carbon emissions. The regional head of the Environmental Protection Administration made the announcement in Denver Wednesday at a solar industry conference.\n“I think the climate crisis is obviously one of the most critical things we have to address now and we have to do it quickly and this money in the Inflation Reduction Act is really going to accelerate our move to clean energy and really address a climate solution,” said regional administrator KC Becker.\nWhile more details will come out this summer, the money will be distributed over the next four years to try to create change and expand the growing renewables industry.\n“We are mostly going to be funding, state local governments, tribes and nonprofits who are then going to take that money and leverage it for clean energy development,” said Becker.\nIt will have to be set for use by 2026. A large percentage will be devoted to communities facing challenges to help low income people afford conversion to renewables and hopefully push the creation of jobs in the industry.\n“It’s going to be a lot more. it’s going to be a lot more on roofs. It’s going to be a lot more in communities, it’s going to be a lot more large thousand-acre facilities,” said Mike Kruger, President and CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association.\n“The IRA represents an enormous opportunity to jump-start both the supply side and the demand side,” said Cary Hayes, President of REC Americas, one of the nation’s bigger players in the solar panel market.\nThe manufacturing of solar panels has slipped away from the United States over the years due to China’s support of its industry, low wages and lax environmental enforcement.\n“I think we need, us as a country, a robust manufacturing presence in this country, said Hayes. “I think it’s in our national interest to do so. From a true financial picture, we’re going to find out 10 years from now.”\nIt is not easy to create manufacturing, he pointed out.\n“It’s not super high on our list currently, to be honest. Because of wage rates, labor rates, demographics and supply chain.”\nColorado itself may not pick up manufacturing because it is easier in places where supply chain proximity is simpler, among other issues.\n“We’re here in the middle of the country in Colorado. Much easier close to a port, someplace, 100, 200 miles away from the water.”\nBut jobs are created with installation, engineering and design.\n“Five plus types of contractors were at my home over some time,” explained Denver homeowner Sekhar Paladugu.\nHe and his husband used incentives and rebates to supplement a full re-do of their home. It has solar on the roof, heat pump furnace and water heater, battery for storage and EV hookup in the garage.\nTheir highest utility bills before conversion were over $650 a month.\n“March might be the first month that I produce more than my house needs,” he shared.\nAnd doing the math, they come out ahead on the cost of all the work.\n“Plan ahead. Make the change that’s better for the climate. Better for the long term, better for your bills,” he said.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

        "story_text": "Corporate ‘greenwashing’ can satisfy stakeholders without environmental results, study finds\nBy Mitchell Consky, CTVNews.ca Writer\nClick here for updates on this story\nToronto, Ontario (CTV Network) — New research suggests that while higher levels of greenhouse gasses produced by businesses initiate negative associations from stakeholders, a company’s market value remains positively linked if they promise climate change initiatives.\nHowever, the actual outcome of those sustainability measures is less important than the optics they create, blurring the line between environmental improvements and corporate greenwashing.\nThis is according to an analysis published in the British Journal of Management, which reviewed 592 firms from 35 countries that have operated between 2002 and 2019 – 17 years that saw a drastic transformation in public perception toward climate change.\n“Despite the steadily growing research within the climate change literature, limited attention has so far been paid to process-based corporate climate change initiatives aimed at improving corporate carbon performance by actual emissions and financial outcomes,” the study reads.\nThe research attempted to investigate the effects of carbon reduction measures and the actual outcome of these measures amidst companies operating in various national economies. The data also considered the effects of carbon-reduction measures being moderated by company sustainability boards.\nThe findings determined that carbon emissions rose along with climate change initiatives, and that low results from those initiatives did not weaken company value.\n“The presence of a board sustainability committee — which plays a crucial role in designing environmental initiatives and introducing best sustainability management practices — was also associated with higher greenhouse gas emissions,” read a press release.\nThe authors of this study suggest that companies are likely to deploy greenwashing strategies to “create positive impressions among stakeholders and protect legitimacy.”\nAlthough carbon-reduction boards throughout companies are working to promote sustainability and satisfy stakeholders, researchers suggest that deeper investigations should be conducted on the results of such efforts to ensure that measures are actually achieving what they set out to do, rather than just appearing to do so.\n“We suggest that examining the moderating role of [sustainability boards] in this context may provide useful insights into corporate climate change strategies/practices across countries with different institutional frameworks and regulatory systems,” the study says.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

        "story_text": "Climate change is costing the US $150 billion a year. Hereâs what that looks like\nBy Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Every three weeks, the United States experiences an extreme weather event that produces $1 billion worth of damage, according to the latest US National Climate Assessment report, released earlier this month. Compare that to 40 years ago, when extreme weather episodes that cost an inflation-adjusted $1 billion happened once every four months on average.\nAs of November 8, there have been 25 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That exceeds last yearâs count â even without data from the last two months of the year.\nIn total, extreme weather events cost the US $150 billion per year, due to direct impacts such as infrastructure damage, worker injuries and agricultural losses, the authors of the report estimate. And the cost of extreme weather events is expected to grow in the near term with a projected rise in sea levels and temperatures, the report states.\nIncluded in this yearâs tally are the devastating wildfires that took place in Hawaii over the summer. The damage from the wildfires, which took the lives of over 100 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, cost $5.6 billion, according to an estimate from the National Centers for Environmental Information, a division of NOAA.\nThere are also important economic implications. For instance, the authors of the report cited separate research published in April by MITâs Center for Real Estate, which found that property damage from hurricanes can result in higher mortgage delinquency rates as property owners become more financially stressed. The authors also cited research that found flooding and rising sea levels lower home prices and property values as more people relocate to areas that are less prone to flooding.\nHurricanes in the United States can also strain government budgets since they tend to lead to substantially higher social safety net disbursements, including unemployment insurance and public medical payments, according to research published in 2017 by Tatyana Deryugina, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nThe National Climate Assessment reportâs estimate of the total annual cost of climate change in the United States takes those factors into account. It does not, however, take into account loss of life and health care-related costs.\n$150 billion at glance\nIt may be hard to appreciate the value of $150 billion without anything to compare it to. Thatâs why CNN sought to find some meaningful examples.\nThe $150 billion annual cost of extreme weather in the damage to the US is:\n- More than Moroccoâs gross domestic product last year, according to World Bank Data\n- About the net worth of Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, according to the Forbes Billionaires list\n- Enough to cover approximately five weeksâ worth of Social Security payments for all recipients as of September, according to CNN estimates based on monthly Social Security Administration data\n- More than what the US government distributed to the 41 million people who received food stamps in 2022, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture\n- Equal to about 9% of the total student loan debt in the United States, according to the New York Federal Reserveâs Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Janet Yellen to deliver major speech detailing US economic strategy toward Indo-Pacific\nBy Matt Egan, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — At a moment of elevated geopolitical danger, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to deliver a major speech on Thursday mapping out the Biden administrationâs economic gameplan toward the increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific region, CNN has learned.\nThe speech will mark the first time the Biden administration has outlined its economic approach toward the region in such detail.\nThe Yellen remarks come ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministersâ meeting later in November and a potential high-stakes summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco.\nA Treasury official tells CNN that Yellen, who visited Beijing over the summer, plans to use the speech on Thursday to emphasize that deeper economic ties with the Indo-Pacific will serve three key objectives: Strengthen US national security, benefit US communities and fuel growth across the region.\nEven as the worldâs attention is on the violence in the Middle East, tensions between China and its neighbors have been on the rise. Recently, China and the Philippines accused each other of causing collisions in a disputed area of the South China Sea.\nDuring the speech before the Asia Society, Yellen plans to detail US efforts to âresponsibly manageâ the relationship with China while simultaneously deepening ties to partners including Japan, South Korea, India and Vietnam and intensifying engagement through multilateral venues like APEC, the Treasury official told CNN.\nMeanwhile, global concern about the health of Chinaâs economy has deepened in recent months as the countryâs real estate bust threatens to infect the broader economy. Investors have been yanking money from Chinaâs stock market at an unprecedented pace amid unease over Beijingâs response.\nIn August, Biden told Democratic donors at a fundraising event that Chinaâs economy is a âticking time bombâ that could prompt leaders in Beijing to lash out.\nâThatâs not good because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things,â Biden told donors.\nDuring this weekâs speech, Yellen also plans to detail the strategic priorities shaping Americaâs economic engagements: Boosting trade and investment in the region while creating a level playing field for American workers and advancing US values and interests; friendshoring and other moves to strengthen supply chains and using economic engagements to address climate change and other global challenges, according to Treasury.\nBeyond the high-profile trip to China, Yellen has visited the Indo-Pacific multiple times during the Biden administration, including four trips to India, two trips each to Japan and Indonesia and visits to Vietnam and Korea.\nIn the wake of the China trip, Washington and Beijing have stepped up their communications, including launching a pair of working groups focused on the economy and financial markets that started meeting last week.\nDuring that two-hour financial working group meeting held virtually, US and Chinese officials discussed fighting terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, domestic and global financial stability and other issues, according to Treasuryâs readout.\nUS-China ties hit a low point earlier this year after Biden ordered a Chinese spy balloon to be shot down over the United States.\nBut Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials have worked to stabilize that relationship, which is arguably the most important on the planet. A Biden-Xi meeting would be a further signal that this relationship has been steadied. The two men havenât spoken in person since November 2022 on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali.\nOn Friday, the White House announced Biden will travel to San Francisco on November 14 to host representatives from the 21 APEC member economies for APEC Economic Leadersâ Week.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Senate committee investigating Floridaâs state-backed home insurance company as private insurers flee\nBy Ella Nilsen, CNN\n(CNN) — The US Senate Budget Committee is launching an investigation intoÂ whetherÂ Floridaâs state-backed home and property insurance company has enough money in the bank to withstand future disasters, as scientists warnï»¿ warming oceans and sea level rise are making storms more destructive.\nCitizens Property Insurance Corporation exists as a so-called insurer of last resort – if owners cannot convince a private insurance company to cover their property, Citizens will step in. It insures about 1.3 million policyholders in the state, who typically pay more money for a policy that covers less.\nBut as coastlines disappear and storms get wetter and more dangerous, risk is through the roof for many of the properties Citizens insures, putting intense financial pressure on the state-backed company. During a March press conference, Floridaâs Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said, âI think most people know Citizens has not been solvent.â\nAfter Florida was walloped in 2022 and 2023 by major hurricanes that together cost more than $100 billionÂ in damages, Committee Chair Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, is writing to top Florida officials asking for documents that show how Citizens is planning to tackle mounting costs and exposure if a massive storm were to hit a major metropolitan area, like Miami or Tampa. The letter was shared first with CNN.\nâFlorida is on the front line of the climate crisis, and it could take just one major hurricane to render Citizens insolvent – a fact the current governor has, himself, admitted,â Whitehouse said in a statement.\nCitizens spokesperson Michael Peltier told CNN the insurer will âcertainly cooperateâ with the committeeâs investigation. In an additional comment provided to CNN on Friday, Peltier said Citizens is âstructured so that it will always be able to protect its policyholders and pay claims.â\nOf major concern to the committee is that if a major city gets hit, millions of Florida policyholders who arenât on Citizens could see massive spikes in their insurance costs. Thatâs because state law says Citizens can tack special assessments onto millions of Floridians with car and home insurance, even if they are insured through private companies, not Citizens.\nIn his Friday comment to CNN, Peltier said this structure is the reason why Citizens would be able to pay out future claims.\nâIf Citizens were to pay out all reserves and reinsurance following a major storm or series of disasters, it is required by Florida law to levy surcharges and assessments on its policyholders and all Florida insurance consumers until any deficit is eliminated,â Peltier stated. âAs such, Citizens will always have the ability to pay claims.â\nPeltier also added the insurer has been reducing the number of its policyholders and âreturning policies to the private market.â\nIn its letter to Florida officials, the Budget Committee expressed concern about âpotential economic consequences of an eventual wide-scale decline in property values.â\nTwo years ago, Citizens wrote that if the state was hit by a 1-in-100-year storm, Florida insurance holders âwould have been on the hook for $24 billion in assessments tacked onto monthly premiums for years.â As the number of Citizens policies have grown, reports from reinsurance companies Munich Re and Swiss Re have found that number could be much higher, anywhere from $36-$162 billion dollars, depending on how severe a future hurricane could be.\nIf that were to happen, the Senate Budget Committee is worried Florida might turn to the federal government looking for a bailout, Whitehouse said.\nâThe Committee has significant concerns about how such an insolvency would affect not only the Florida real estate market, but also the broader economy and the federal budget,â he said.Â âShould Florida look to the federal government for emergency relief, all American taxpayers could be on the hook.â\nFears about a possible federal bailout are not unfounded, Benjamin Keys, a real estate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN.\nâThey absolutely have a reason to be concerned; the exposure is enormous,â Keys said. â1.3 million of the riskiest policies in the riskiest state, full stop. Itâs correlated exposure â if a hurricane hits your house, it hits my house.â\nâAn extreme amount of riskâ\nOf the states that have state-backed insurers of last resort, Floridaâs is by far the largest. It has steadily increased the number of consumers who canât get insurance anywhere else, as private insurers have pulled out of the state and smaller insurers have gone bankrupt after back-to-back major hurricanes.\nState insurers of last resort were originally intended as a stopgap for consumers, ensuring their coverage wouldnât be interrupted. But in Florida in particular, many more people have been forced onto Citizens as other insurers flee the state or go bankrupt, in part because the state is particularly vulnerable to climate change-fueled losses like hurricanes and rising sea levels, according to the Senate Budget Committee letter.\nThat is amplified by the fact that Citizensâ policyholders have some of the riskiest properties in the state, Keys added, such as properties on the coast or ones that have flooded multiple times.\nFlorida isnât alone; some major private insurers have either pulled out or stopped writing new policies in wildfire-prone California. And premiums have also spiked for consumers on CaliforniaâsÂ insurer of last resort â known as the FAIR Plan.\nBut Keys said there are two important things differentiating Californiaâs FAIR plan with Floridaâs Citizens. For one thing, California has far fewer consumers on its state-backed insurance â a little more than 268,000 compared to Floridaâs 1.3 million. And second, if a major wildfire or storm were to hit California, state law there puts insurance companies on the hook for the high cost of special assessments, rather than individual policyholders.\nâThe scale is just enormous,â Keys said. âAt that scale, that means thereâs an extreme amount of risk.â\nKeys said the Senate Budget Committeeâs investigation signals the federal government is trying to get in front of a future potential disaster â and the billions of damages it could bring.\nâWe know that in the event of a crisis, itâs very hard for the federal government to withhold aid and support,â Keys said. âItâs not a good look.â\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from a Citizens Property Insurance Corporation spokesperson.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "The United States is producing more oil than any country in history\nBy Matt Egan, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — As the world grapples with the existential crisis of climate change, environmental activists want President Joe Biden to phase out the oil industry, and Republicans argue heâs already doing that. Meanwhile, the surprising reality is the United States is pumping oil at a blistering pace and is on track to produce more oil than any country has in history.\nThe United States is set to produce a global record of 13.3 million barrels per day of crude and condensate during the fourth quarter of this year, according to a report published Tuesday by S&P Global Commodity Insights.\nLast month, weekly US oil production hit 13.2 million barrels per day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Thatâs just above the Donald Trump-era record of 13.1 million set in early 2020 just before the Covid-19 crisis sent output and prices crashing.\nThatâs been helping to keep a lid on crude and gasoline prices.\nUS output â led by shale oil drillers in Texas and New Mexicoâs Permian Basin â is so strong that itâs sending supplies overseas. America is exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia produces, S&P said.\nâItâs a reminder that the US is endowed with enormous oil reserves. Our industry should never be underestimated,â said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group.\nRecord-shattering US production is helping to offset aggressive supply cuts meant to support high prices by OPEC+, mainly Saudi Arabia and Russia. Other non-OPEC oil producers including Canada and Brazil are also pumping more oil than ever before. (Brazil is set to join OPEC+ next year.)\nThe strength of US output has caught experts off guard. Goldman Sachs analysts on Sunday cut their forecast for oil prices next year. The bank said the âkey reasonâ behind the lowered forecast is the abundance of US supply.\nGlobal demand for crude oil is set to hit a record in 2024 â but it will âeasily be metâ by the growth in supply, according to S&Pâs projections.\nGas prices near $3\nAll of this has helped to keep oil prices relatively in check. After flirting with $100 a barrel earlier this year, crude has since tumbled back to the $70 to $75 range.\nEnergy prices have jumped this week after BP halted shipments through the Red Sea due to security concerns. Still, US oil is trading below $74 a barrel, well below where it was when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.\nGas prices neared the psychologically important level of $4 a gallon in September. But prices at the pump have since fallen sharply, helping to ease inflationary pressure on the US economy.\nThe national average for a gallon of regular gas stood at $3.08 a gallon on Tuesday, down from $3.14 a year ago, according to AAA.\nâBidenâs war on energyâ\nDespite record-setting production, Biden has come under fire for his energy policy.\nâUnfortunately, this Administration continues to pursue policies designed to limit access to new productionâmost notably on federal lands and waters. The world will continue to demand more energy, not less, and we urge policymakers to recognize the role American energy production can play as a stabilizing force for consumers here at home and around the world,â American Petroleum Institute Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs Dustin Meyer, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nIn September, the House subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a hearing titled: âBidenâs War on Domestic Energy Threatens Every American.â\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska warned in a floor speech that the Biden administrationâs war on energy is a âgift to our adversaries.â\nEarlier this month at a GOP presidential primary debate, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vowed to âopen up all of our domestic energy for productionâ to âlower your gas prices.â DeSantis made a similar comment at the CNN town hall last week.\nThat the US is about to produce more oil than any country ever before undercuts the argument that Biden has waged a war on American energy.\nPresidents donât set oil production\nOf course, that doesnât mean itâs Biden policies that have paved the way for record US oil production, nor that the White House would rush to take credit for that.\nMcNally, a former energy official to former President George W. Bush, said there isnât that much presidents can do about US oil production, short of taking drastic emergency powers.\nUnlike OPEC nations, the United States oil output is largely set by the free market.\nâItâs not like President Biden or any president has a dial in the Oval Office to increase production,â McNally said.\nInstead, the spike in US output has been driven by smarter and more efficient operations by oil companies. Energy firms have figured out ways to squeeze more and more oil out of the ground â often without increasing drilling dramatically.\nThe shale oil revolution has been driven by new drilling techniques that have unlocked new resources. But this technique can be more complex and requires vast amounts of water.\nâKicking and screamingâ\nYet McNally said the White House has been forced to shift its tone on fossil fuels from the climate-focused stance of 2020 and early 2021 to something more neutral.\nLast year, gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, which set off a panic in the oil market. Biden urged US oil companies to pump more oil â exactly the opposite of what climate scientists are calling for.\nIn March, the Biden administration even approved the Willow oil drilling project, a controversial ConocoPhillips drilling venture in Alaska that had been stalled for decades. That green light came in the face of deep criticism from climate groups worried about the environmental and health risks.\nâPresident Biden has been dragged kicking and screaming from his initial keep-it-in-the-ground strategy towards a more pragmatic policy,â McNally said, noting the administration was âmugged by the reality of high gas prices and Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Degradation of Amazon rainforest by humans is causing as many carbon emissions as deforestation: study\nBy Alexandra Mae Jones, CTVNews.ca\nClick here for updates on this story\nTORONTO (CTV Network) — About a third of the remaining Amazon rainforest has been severely degraded by human activity, and the emissions from this activity are equivalent to or even greater than emissions caused by deforestation, according to a new study.\nThe Amazon rainforest, at roughly 6.7 million square kilometres, is the largest forest in the world, and has long been important as a carbon sink and a biodiversity hotspot.\nAlthough alarm bells have been ringing about the increasing reach of deforestation in the Amazon for years—around 17 per cent of the forest has disappeared over the last 50 years—human activity has been simultaneously damaging the Amazon in other ways, researchers say.\nAn international team of scientists found that 38 per cent of the Amazon, an area 10 times greater than the size of the U.K., has been degraded by human activity or events caused by human activity, such as forest fires and selective logging.\n“Even in an optimistic scenario, when there is no more deforestation, the effects of climate change will see degradation of the forest continue, leading to further carbon emissions,” Dr. David Lapola, leader of the study and researcher at the Centre for Meteorological and Climatic Research Applied to Agriculture at Unicamp, said in a press release.\nThe study, published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Science, is the result of an analysis of existing data, including satellite imagery showing the changes of the Amazon, and catalogues the changes in the Amazon region between 2001 and 2018.\nResearchers project that by 2050, the degradation of the Amazon will be one of the major sources of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, regardless of whether or not the Amazon continues to suffer massive deforestation or not. HOW DEGRADATION IS HURTING THE AMAZON\nDeforestation is relatively straightforward—it refers to when trees are totally cleared and a new use for the land is established, such as for agriculture. Since trees store carbon, deforestation also releases a large amount of carbon emissions.\nBut while this phenomenon has been studied significantly, degradation is an equal threat, this new study claims, and one we need to be paying attention to.\nResearchers define degradation as transient or long-term changes in an area of the forest caused by humans. This may include situations where an area loses many or even all of its trees, but the land is not repurposed for another use outside of being part of the forest.\n“Despite uncertainty about the total effect of these disturbances, it is clear that their cumulative effect can be as important as deforestation for carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,” Jos Barlow, professor of conservation science at Lancaster University and co-author of the paper, said in the release.\nResearchers looked at the impacts of forest fires, selective logging, extreme drought and edge effects, which are changes in forests adjacent to areas that have been cleared through deforestation.\nThey found that between 2001 and 2018, the total area of the Amazon rainforest that was under degradation was greater than the amount lost to deforestation in that time period.\nAnd this has huge impacts on carbon emissions.\nIn this new study, researchers found that carbon emissions from areas of the Amazon degraded by human activity during the study period totalled 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year. A petagram is a billion metric tons, or a unit of mass equal to a quadrillion grams, and 0.2 petagrams is roughly two hundred billion kilograms.\nIn the same time period, the carbon emissions from deforestation were roughly 0.06-0.21 petagrams.\nForests are the biggest form of carbon capture that exist on the planet. A report published earlier this month found that almost all of the carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere and stored is removed by forests, underlining the huge importance of forests in maintaining our global climate.\nBut scientists are worried that the Amazon is in danger of producing more carbon than it is removing from the environment, due to deforestation and degradation.\nSome of the causes of degradation are directly connected to global climate change, the study stated, such as extreme drought, a type of extreme weather that has become more common as Earth warms. While tackling deforestation will aid with combatting edge effects, there need to be greater changes made globally to reduce impacts such as extreme drought and forest fires.\nAs the study only looks at data up to 2018, it doesn’t address whether the degradation has gotten worse as deforestation has. In 2022, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest hit a record high for the first six months, according to Reuters, with experts connecting the increase to former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro, who stripped environmental regulations and protections during his time in office between 2019 and 2022.\nResearchers also noted that degradation of the Amazon not only hurts our environment, but disproportionately affects Indigenous communities and others that rely on the forest.\n“Degradation benefits the few, but places important burdens on many,” Rachel Carmenta, a co-author based at the University of East Anglia, said in the release. “Few people profit from the degradation processes, yet many lose out across all dimensions of human well-being—including health, nutrition and the place attachments held for the forest landscapes where they live. Furthermore, many of these burdens are hidden at present; recognising them will help enable better governance with social justice at the centre.”\nThe study states that there should be a monitoring system for forest degradation and that illegal logging and use of fire should be curbed in order to cut down on these issues. And although tackling deforestation is important, the need to tackle degradation specifically is important to keep in mind, researchers say.\n“Public and private actions and policies to curb deforestation will not necessarily address degradation as well,” Dr. Lapola said in the release. “It is necessary to invest in innovative strategies.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

        "story_text": "The climate crisis is coming for your hoppy beer\nBy Rachel Ramirez, CNN\n(CNN) — Hops in major beer-producing European countries like Germany, Czech Republic and Slovenia are ripening earlier and producing less since 1994, scientists found. And, perhaps most alarmingly for the IPA lovers of the world, they are starting to lose their critical bitter component.\nItâs going to get worse, researchers say. Hop yields could decline by as much as 18% by 2050, and their alpha acid content â which makes beer bitter â could decrease by up to 31% due to hotter and drier conditions, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\nThe findings add to a growing list of things the climate crisis threatens yet people take for granted, said Miroslav Trnka, co-author of the study and researcher at the Global Change Research Institute.\nâOne of the side motives of this study was to illustrate how climate change might be important for even those who think it doesnât matter,â Trnka told CNN. âWe are really seeing changes that are affecting things that we value, like the taste of beer. Climate change really can have an effect on it, or at least have an effect on commodities that are critical for production.â\nBeer brewing has been around since at least 3100 BC, the study notes. Now, each of the basic ingredients of todayâs beer â water, barley, yeast and hops â are threatened by global warming.\nâWith climate change affecting a vast number of agricultural crops, Iâm not surprised,â said Douglass Miller, a senior lecturer in food and beverage management at Cornell University who is not involved in the study.\nâHops are also finicky plants and there might be some crop failures,â Miller said, which could lead brewers to work with different flavor profiles from other types of hops.\nResearchers used weather data and climate models to analyze how European hops have been and will be affected by climate change between 1970 and 2050, assuming precipitation decreases and temperature increases.\nScorching temperatures have already shifted the start of hop growing season by 13 days from 1970 to 2018, according to the study. The growth of new shoots from the hop plant typically occurs during the spring, but since 1995, the researchers found itâs happening earlier in the regions analyzed than years prior.\nThis early onset triggers earlier harvests, which could make it more difficult for hop growers to schedule harvesting and processing operations.\nIn recent years, more consumers are preferring beer aromas and flavors that require higher-quality hops, according to the study. Since these hops are only grown in smaller regions, researchers say theyâre put at even higher risk from climate change-fueled heat waves and droughts.\nâHop farmers have changed the locations of hop fields in response to changes in temperature and precipitation and that is likely to continue,â said Mark Sorrells, a professor at Cornell Universityâs School of Integrative Plant Science who is not involved with the study.\nAnd while craft brews with aroma hops may be popular now, consumer preferences could change as growers adapt, Sorrells added.\nWhile this study only focused on major hop-growing European countries â which cover nearly 90% of the total area of aromatic hop fields in the continent â Trnka said itâs also representative of what could happen in beer-producing regions in the US such as the Pacific Northwest, where record-shattering heatwaves are occurring more often than usual.\nâThey are facing similar problems like European (countries), perhaps a slightly different timing and different frequency but climate change is cumulatively affecting both regions in very similar ways,â Trnka said.\nBeer remains one of the worldâs most widely consumed beverages. Even in a hotter future, people will still find ways to brew it, Trnka said â but it may not taste the same.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

After years of sea ice increases, Antarctic sea ice started declining from 2016 and the region is now reporting record lows.\nArctic sea ice extent was 4% below average, with the Barents Sea and Svalbard most affected, Copernicus data showed.\nIt wasn’t hot everywhere. Below average temperatures were recorded in countries including Siberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia.

        "story_text": "Dry canals, low rivers and shrunken lakes: Europe braces for severe drought amid winter heatwave\nBy Christian Edwards and Gabby Gretener, CNN\nA winter heatwave, record low levels of rain and a startling lack of snow in Europe are pushing rivers, canals and lakes across the continent to alarmingly low levels, with experts warning there could be repeat of last year’s severe droughts.\nImages of dried-up river beds and shrunken lakes are usually associated with the scorching heat of summer — not the winter. But an exceptionally warm and dry start to the year is affecting a swath of Europe, including central and southwest France, northern Spain and northern Italy.\nThere are concerns for what this might mean for water supplies.\nEurope’s water situation has become “very precarious,” according to a study published in January by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria, which used satellite data to analyze the world’s groundwater resources.\n“A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe,” said Torsten Mayer-Gürr, one of the researchers. “We are actually getting problems with the water supply here — we have to think about this.”\nRecord-breaking dry spell in France\nFrance, which is experiencing its driest stretch in more than 60 years, may soon bring in water restrictions.\nThe country “suffered a series of 32 consecutive days without any significant rainfall from January 21 to February 21,” Simon Mittelberger, a climatologist at Météo-France, told CNN — the longest stretch since records began in 1959.\nIt is having a damaging effect on the country’s rivers and lakes, Mittelberger said, as well as the country’s soils.\n“Soils are much drier than usual,” he said. France’s current soil moisture levels would not normally be seen until mid-April.\nSnowfall has also been low. “The situation in the Pyrenees is close to the lowest record of snow quantity for that time of year,” Mittelberger said. The Alps have seen 63% less snow than usual, according to CIMA Research Foundation.\nA lack of snow in the winter can threaten water reserves in the spring and summer, as there is less snowmelt to sustain rivers.\nLast summer, France suffered its worst drought on record but, Mittelberger warned, this year “the situation could be worse if we don’t have significant rainfall in the next couple of months.”\nChristophe Béchu, the minister for ecological transition, called the winter drought “unprecedented,” and warned the country is in a state of alert.\nExposed lake beds and dried up canals\nIn Italy, some of country’s most famous bodies of water are drying up.\nWater levels at Lake Garda are so low that it is now possible to walk to an island in the middle, along a strip of exposed lake bed. A few months ago, this walkway did not exist.\nIt is now also a lot harder to take a water taxi in Venice, as some of its canals have become too shallow to keep gondolas afloat, in part, because of a lack of rainfall.\nThe city which has long feared flooding is now grappling with the opposite problem.\nItaly’s longest river, the Po, which winds through its northern agricultural heartland, has 61% less water than usual for this time of year.\nLast summer, the Italian government declared a state of emergency for the area surrounding the Po, which experienced its worst drought in 70 years.\nGiorgio Zampetti, general manager of Legambiente, an Italian environmental group, fears that the worst is yet to come: “2023 has just begun, but it is showing worrying signs in terms of extreme weather events [and] drought levels,” he said in a press statement.\nFears for water supplies\nIn Spain, which experienced its hottest year on record last year, there are concerns about water supplies.\n“We cannot guarantee water supply for drinking water or for economic uses by relying exclusively on rain,” Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition recently said at a press conference.\nThe country has approved plans to invest around $24 billion in water management, including measures to improve sanitation and treatment and modernize irrigation.\nSince 1980 the average available water has decreased by 12%, with projections that there may be a further decrease of up to 40% by 2050.\nDry weather in Spain is also threatening the country’s prized jamón ibérico bellota, as low rainfall and rising temperatures affect the acorns eaten by the pigs.\n“The coming weeks will be crucial”\nWhile Europe has previously been blighted by summer droughts, experts fear the exceptionally dry last two months may signal a new reality, caused in part by rising average global temperatures.\n“These conditions were rare in the past, but climate change is altering precipitation regimes over Europe and making these extremes more recurrent and intense,” Andrea Toreti, a climatologist at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, told CNN.\n“There is a growing concern due to the lack of precipitation in the last weeks and also considering the 2022 drought. The coming weeks will be crucial,” Torerti said.\nWhile Toreti said attributing the winter drought to climate change would require a specific analysis that has not yet been conducted, he added such events “are an expected effect of climate change in terms of more frequent and intense extremes.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Scientists find a way to suck up carbon pollution, turn it into baking soda and store it in the oceans\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nScientists have set out a way to suck planet-heating carbon pollution from the air, turn it into sodium bicarbonate and store it in oceans, according to a new paper.\nThe technique could be up to three times more efficient than current carbon capture technology, say the authors of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.\nTackling the climate crisis means drastically reducing the burning of fossil fuels, which releases planet-heating pollution. But because humans have already pumped so much of this pollution into the atmosphere and are unlikely to sufficiently reduce emissions in the near term, scientists say we also need to remove it from the air.\nNature does this — forests and oceans, for example, are valuable carbon sinks — but not quickly enough to keep pace with the amounts humans are producing. So we have turned to technology.\nOne method is to capture carbon pollution directly at the source, for example from steel or cement plants.\nBut another way, which this study focuses on, is “direct air capture.” This involves sucking carbon pollution directly out of the atmosphere and then storing it, often by injecting it into the ground.\nThe problem with direct air capture is that while carbon dioxide may be a very potent planet-heating gas, its concentrations are very small — it makes up about 0.04% of air. This means removing it directly from the air is challenging and expensive.\nIt’s a “significant hurdle,” Arup SenGupta, a professor at Lehigh University and a study author, told CNN.\nEven the biggest facilities can only remove relatively small amounts and it costs several hundred dollars to remove each ton of carbon.\nClimeworks’ direct air removal project in Iceland is the largest facility, according to the company, and can capture up to 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. That’s equivalent to the carbon pollution produced by fewer than 800 cars over a year.\nThe new technique laid out in the study can help tackle those problems, said SenGupta.\nThe team have used copper to modify the absorbent material used in direct air capture. The result is an absorbent “which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere at ultra-dilute concentration at a capacity which is two to three times greater than existing absorbents,” SenGupta said.\nThis material can be produced easily and cheaply and would help drive down the costs of direct air capture, he added.\nOnce the carbon dioxide is captured, it can then be turned into sodium bicarbonate — baking soda — using seawater and released into the ocean at a small concentration.\nThe oceans “are infinite sinks,” SenGupta said. “If you put all the CO2 from the atmosphere, emitted every day — or every year — into the ocean, the increase in concentration would be very, very minor,” he said.\nSenGupta’s idea is that direct air capture plants can be located offshore, giving them access to abundant amounts of seawater for the process.\nStuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the chemistry was “novel and elegant.”\nThe process is a modification of one we already know, he said, “which is easier to understand, scale-up and develop than something totally new.”\nBut there may be regulatory hurdles to surmount. “Disposing of large tonnages of sodium bicarbonate in the ocean could be legally defined as ‘dumping,’ which is banned by international treaties,” Haszeldine said.\nOthers remain concerned about negative impacts on the oceans, which are already under pressure from climate change, pollution and other human activity.\nPeter Styring, professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at the University of Sheffield, told CNN: “Unless you’ve got a full eco-toxic study, then you don’t know what it’s going to do, even at small concentrations.”\nDirect air capture also remains expensive and inefficient, Styring said. “This is a big scale problem. Why would you capture from the atmosphere when you’ve got so much coming out of power stations and industrial plants? It just makes sense to go for the high concentrations first,” he said.\nSome scientists have expressed concerns that a focus on technology to remove carbon pollution could distract from policies to reduce fossil fuel burning, or could give polluters license to carry on polluting.\nBut given the scale of the climate crisis, there is a big push from governments and international bodies to scale up this technology.\nMore research will be needed to understand how the method works at scale, Haszeldine said. But it’s promising, he added, saying “the world needs lots of this type of discovery.”\nSenGupta said the technology is ready to be taken out of the lab and trialed. “This is the time to go forward and do something in maybe two or three different places around the world. Let other people get involved, find faults, improve on it, and then proceed accordingly,” he said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "Long-term exposure to air pollution may raise risk of depression later in life, study says\nBy Jen Christensen, CNN\nExposure to air pollution may be tied to the risk of developing depression later in life, a large new study finds.\nScientists are finding more and more evidence that people who live in polluted areas have a higher risk of depression than those who live with cleaner air. But this study published Friday in JAMA Network Open is one of the first to examine the associations between long-term exposure and the risk of depression diagnosed after age 64.\nDepression itself is a serious health condition. When it develops in an older adult, it can also contribute to problems with the ability to think clearly, studies show, as well as physical problems and even death.\nPrevious research has found that a new diagnosis of depression is less common among older adults than in younger populations.\n“That’s one of the biggest reason we wanted to conduct this analysis,” said Dr. Xinye Qiu, co-author of the new study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open. Qiu is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Surprisingly, we saw a large number of late-onset depression diagnoses in this study.”\nThe researchers looked at information on more than 8.9 million people who got their health insurance through Medicare and found that more than 1.52 million were diagnosed with depression later in life during the study period of 2005 to 2016. But the number is probably an undercount; studies show that late-in-life depression is often underdiagnosed.\nTo determine the study participants’ pollution exposure, Qiu and her co-authors looked at where each of the people diagnosed with depression lived and created models to determine the exposure to pollution at each ZIP code, averaged across a year.\nThe researchers looked at the study participants’ exposure to three kinds of air pollution: fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5 or particle pollution; nitrogen dioxide; and ozone.\nParticle pollution is the mix of solid and liquid droplets floating in the air. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires.\nPM2.5 is so tiny — 1/20th of a width of a human hair — that it can travel past your body’s usual defenses.\nInstead of being carried out when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and may lead to respiratory problems. Exposure can cause cancer, stroke or heart attack; it could also aggravate asthma, and it has long been associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety.\nNitrogen dioxide pollution is most commonly associated with traffic-related combustion byproducts. Nitrogen oxides are also released from traffic, as well as through the burning of oil, coal and natural gas. Exposure can increase inflammation of the airways, cause coughing or wheezing and reduce lung function.\nOzone pollution is the main ingredient in smog. It comes from cars, power plants and refineries. This particular pollution is best known for exacerbating asthma symptoms, and long-term exposure studies show a higher risk of death from respiratory diseases in people with higher exposures. The American Lung Association calls it one of the “least well-controlled pollutants in the United States,” and it’s one of the most dangerous.\nIn the new study, the scientists found that people who lived in areas with higher pollution levels long-term had an increased risk of a depression diagnosis. All three of the pollutants studied were associated with a higher risk of late-onset depression, even at lower pollution levels.\n“So there’s no real threshold, so it means future societies will want to eliminate this pollution or reduce it as much as possible because it carries a real risk,” Qiu said.\nThere were greater associations between depression and exposure to particle pollution and nitrogen dioxide among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. That may in part be because they are simultaneously exposed to social stress and these poor environmental conditions, the study says.\nOlder adults who had underlying problems with their heart or breathing were also more sensitive to developing late-in-life depression when exposed to nitrogen dioxide pollution, the study found.\nThe study has some limitations. The majority of the participants were White, and more research would be needed to see whether there would be a difference among diverse populations.\nThis is also a population-level study, so there is no way to pinpoint exactly why people exposed to these kinds of air pollutions would have a higher risk of depression.\nOther studies have found that exposure to air pollution may affect the central nervous system, causing inflammation and damaging the body’s cells.\nSome air pollution, studies show, can also cause the body to release harmful substances that can hurt the blood-brain barrier, the network of blood vessels and tissues made up of closely spaced cells that protect the brain, and that may lead to depression and anxiety.\nBecause aging can impair the immune response, older adults may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution. More research will be needed to fully understand these connections, as the neural basis for depression is not completely understood.\nAnother possibility may be that people who live in polluted areas develop physical problems that are associated with worsening psychiatric health, the study said.\n“Late-life depression should be a geriatric issue that the public and researchers need to be paying more attention to, like on a similar level with Alzheimer’s and other neurological conditions,” Qiu said.\nShe is particularly concerned about the effects that climate change will have on this phenomenon. Ozone pollution will increase as the world gets warmer, and the study found that ozone pollution had a stronger association to late-onset depression than particle and nitrogen dioxide pollution.\n“Because of this concerning effect we are seeing with ozone, it makes more sense for the government to put some regulation on pollution and also climate mitigation, because rising temperatures and ozone pollution are definitely linked to each other,” Qiu said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "The UK is delaying the switch to electric cars. Automakers are furious\nBy Hanna Ziady, CNN\nLondon (CNN) — The UK government said Wednesday it would delay a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars by five years, angering carmakers who warned the move would undermine the industryâs efforts to switch to electric vehicles.\nThe delay was announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as he watered down some of the governmentâs green energy policies, despite fierce opposition from climate campaigners, members of his own party and business.\nâWe seem to have defaulted to an approach that will impose unacceptable costs on hard-pressed British families,â Sunak said. If the government stuck to its current climate policies âwe risk losing the consent of the British people.â\nSunak said people would be able to buy new gasoline and diesel cars until 2035, instead of 2030, aligning the UK with countries such as Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Canada and Sweden.\nâWe are going to ease the transition to electric vehicles,â he said. âWe will still meet our international commitments and hit net zero by 2050.â\nThe UK announced the 2030 ban in 2020, putting it on course to become the first major economy to decarbonize road transport â an essential step towards meeting its net zero commitments.\nSunakâs plans had been widely reported and automakers criticized the expected policy shift earlier Wednesday. They have committed billions to electrify their fleets ahead of the deadline and were hopeful that the 2030 target would boost demand for electric vehicles.\nâOur business needs three things from the UK government: ambition, commitment, and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three,â Ford (F) UK chair Lisa Brankin said in a statement.\nâWe need the policy focus trained on bolstering the EV market in the short term and supporting consumers while headwinds are strong: infrastructure remains immature, tariffs loom and cost-of-living is high,â Brankin added.\nJust last week, BMW announced a Â£600 million ($743 million) government-backed investment to build electric Minis at its Oxford and Swindon factories in the UK. The Mini brand is set to become purely electric from 2030 globally.\nâWe and the whole automotive industry [need] clarity on the [EV] topic,â the German carmaker said in a statement shared with CNN.\nStellantis (STLA), which owns the Fiat, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n brands, echoed the call for clarity and said it was committed to achieving 100% zero emission new car and van sales in the UK by the end of the decade.\nEarlier this month, the company â formed from the merger between Fiat Chrysler and Franceâs PSA Group â marked the start of electric vehicle production at its Ellesmere Port facility outside Liverpool. It invested Â£100 million ($124 million) to transform the plant for EV production.\nâConfusionâ will delay switch to EVs\nThe UK auto industry has been clawing its way back from rock bottom after car manufacturing hit a 66-year low in 2022. The industry had also fallen behind in the race to develop EVs due to a dearth of local battery production.\nIt received a shot in the arm in July when Indiaâs Tata Group said it would invest more than Â£4 billion ($4.9 billion) to build a UK gigafactory set to provide almost half of the batteries the UK will need by 2030.\nThe latest policy change could set back that progress and ultimately harm the economy if it jeopardizes the future of the UKâs auto manufacturing sector.\nIf Britain is to be a leader in phasing out polluting vehicles, âconsumers must want to make the switch, which requires from government a clear, consistent message, attractive incentives and charging infrastructure that gives confidence rather than anxiety,â said Mike Hawes, CEO of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry body.\nâConfusion and uncertainty will only hold them back,â he added. Reducing emissions from road transport âis the only way that you will achieve net zero,â Hawes told the BBC.\nThe governmentâs own independent adviser on climate policy, the Climate Change Committee shares that view. In a 2020 report, the committee said that the âfull transitionâ to EVs will be âone of the most important actions to achieve the UKâs net zero target.â\nJobs at stake\nIn diluting the governmentâs climate policies, Sunak was likely bolstered by the outcome of a recent election in which his Conservative Party managed to retain a London seat it was widely expected to lose after voters rebelled against the cityâs Ultra Low Emission Zone.\nThe ULEZ, which charges drivers Â£12.50 ($15.50) every day they use a car that doesnât meet tough emissions standards, has been expanded by the opposition Labour Partyâs London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\nâWe need sensible green leadership,â Sunak said âWeâre stuck between two extremes: those who want to abandon net zero altogether â¦ [and] others who argue with an ideological zeal we must move even faster.â\nBut he faces criticism from within his own party. Pulling back on the climate agenda âwill not help economically or electorally,â former business and energy minister Alok Sharma, who was president of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\nSimon Clarke, another Conservative lawmaker, said on X that the move will âshatterâ the UKâs consensus on tackling the climate crisis.\nIt could also hurt an industry that employs 780,000 people and accounts for 10% of UK exports. Most industry executives agree that a shift to electric cars is inevitable. And that shift is already gathering momentum in Britain.\nEVs are expected to account for nearly 18% of new car registrations by the end of the year, up from just 0.7% in 2018, according to the SMMT.\nIf policy missteps or waning government support cause the UK to become an unattractive place to manufacture EVs, that could threaten the future of Britainâs auto sector.\nâ Gemma Blundell-Doyle, Anna Cooban, Laura Paddison and Rob Picheta contributed reporting.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Biden issues his first veto on retirement investment resolution\nBy Clare Foran and Betsy Klein, CNN\nPresident Joe Biden issued the first veto of his presidency Monday on a resolution to overturn a retirement investment rule that allows managers of retirement funds to consider the impact of climate change and other environmental, social and governance factors when picking investments.\nRepublican lawmakers led the push to pass the resolution through Congress, arguing the rule is “woke” policy that pushes a liberal agenda on Americans and will hurt retirees’ bottom lines, while Democrats say it’s not about ideology and will help investors.\nThe resolution, which would rescind a Department of Labor rule, passed both chambers of Congress with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana voting with Republicans in the Senate.\n“I just signed this veto because legislation passed by the Congress would put at risk the retirement savings of individuals across the country. They couldn’t take into consideration investments that wouldn’t be impacted by climate, impacted by overpaying executives, and that’s why I decided to veto it — it makes sense to veto it,” Biden said in a video posted to social media Monday afternoon.\nBiden is seen signing the veto in the video, taken in the Oval Office earlier Monday.\nThe veto makes good on Biden’s frequent promise to veto legislation passed by the GOP-controlled House he disagrees with. Even before Republicans took control of that chamber, Biden often mentioned his ability to nix their priorities. “The good news is I’ll have a veto pen,” he told a group of donors in Chicago just days before November’s midterm elections.\nOpponents of the rule could try to override Biden’s veto, but at this point it appears unlikely they could get the two-thirds majority needed in each chamber to do so.\nBiden’s first presidential veto reflects the reality of a changed political order in Washington with Republicans now in control of the House after they won back the chamber from Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.\nPreviously, Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate. Now, the president’s party only has a majority in the Senate.\nMost legislation passed by the current GOP-controlled House will not be able to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the resolution to overturn the investment rule only needed a simple majority to pass in the Senate. Republican lawmakers advanced it under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to roll back regulations from the executive branch without needing to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that is necessary for most legislation.\nOpponents of the rule have argued that it politicizes retirement investments and that the Biden administration is using it as a way to promote a liberal agenda.\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said at a news conference earlier this year, “What’s happened here is the woke and weaponized bureaucracy at the Department of Labor has come out with new regulations on retirement funds, and they want retirement funds to be invested in things that are consistent with their very liberal, left-wing agenda.”\nSupporters of the rule argue that it is not a mandate — it allows, but does not require, the consideration of environmental, social and governance factors in investment selection.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in defense of the rule that Republicans are “using the same tired attacks we’ve heard for a while now that this is more wokeness. … But Republicans are missing or ignoring an important point: Nothing in the (Labor Department) rule imposes a mandate.”\n“This isn’t about ideological preference, it’s about looking at the biggest picture possible for investments to minimize risk and maximize returns,” he said, noting it’s a narrow rule that is “literally allowing the free market to do its work.”\nThe statement of administration policy warning that Biden would veto the measure if presented with it similarly states, “the 2022 rule is not a mandate — it does not require any fiduciary to make investment decisions based solely on ESG factors. The rule simply makes sure that retirement plan fiduciaries must engage in a risk and return analysis of their investment decisions and recognizes that these factors can be relevant to that analysis.”\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Fed Chair Powell hints that soaring bond yields could mean end of rate hikes\nBy Bryan Mena, CNN\nWashington, DC (CNN) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that soaring bond yields could help the Fed slow the economy, further cooling inflation and the possibly signaling the end of rate hikes. But he stopped short of declaring victory, citing the economyâs resilience.\nâTight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation,â Powell said during a discussion at the Economic Club of New York.\nWhile he acknowledged steady progress on slowing inflation â and the role of rising yields â he still left additional action from the Fed on the table. Whether the Fed raises rates or not depends on the economyâs performance in the coming months. The 10-year Treasury yield was close to breaching 5% on Thursday.\nTreasury yields have soared recently on expectations that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, which could slow the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield fluctuated slightly on Thursday as Powell spoke about inflation and the economy, but continued to hover just under the 5% threshold last breached in 2007.\nBalancing act\nIf economic growth continues to be robust and inflationâs descent stalls, a rate hike in December is in play, though a November pause seems to be cemented. But the Fed chair isnât ready to make any pronouncements just yet, saying the Fed would continue to proceed carefully.\nâA range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little,â Powell said Thursday.\nThe job market, economic growth and consumer spending have all held steady despite the Fedâs 11 rate hikes, and the war between Israel and Hamas could rattle global energy markets if the conflict escalates to destabilize the broader, oil-rich Middle East.\nThe Fed chief said the attack on Israel earlier this month was âhorrifying,â and he warned of the uncertain outcome of âhighly elevatedâ geopolitical tensions on the global economy.\nShortly before Powell was set to deliver his prepared remarks, climate change protesters approached the front of the stage, unfurling a sign and chanting. The eventâs live stream was turned off and Powell was quickly escorted off the stage as security forcibly removed the protesters from the room. The event continued a few minutes later.\nThe protesters were from a climate activist group called Climate Defiance, whose stated mission is to âend fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters,â according to a post on its site. Protesters from the group interrupted Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigiegâs remarks at a conference held in Baltimore last week.\nNo âunnecessary harmâ\nPowellâs strategy echoes that of other Fed officials, who have said the central bankâs decisions are based on doing just enough to defeat inflation while not doing so much that its actions trigger higher unemployment, or risking âunnecessary harm to the economy,â as he put it.\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, who holds an influential role at the US central bank, also laid out that strategy earlier this month, saying that the Fed should âbalance the risk of not having tightened enough, against the risk of policy being too restrictive.â\nFinancial markets are overwhelmingly pricing in another Fed pause on rate hikes for the October 31-November 1 meeting, but the chances of an additional pause in December are much lower, at around 61%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThe economic landscape\nUS inflation has slowed markedly from its four-decade peak last summer as the Fed raised short-term rates at its most aggressive pace since the 1980s. The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 3.7% in September from a year earlier, up from Juneâs 3% annual rate, mostly due to rising gas prices, but still down from the 9.1% rate in June 2022. Thatâs a welcome development for the Fed, but officials arenât quite yet ready to declare victory.\nThe Fedâs preferred inflation gauge has shown a similar deceleration, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rising 3.9% for the 12 months ended in August, the lowest annual increase that index has seen in two years. Inflation is still above the Fedâs 2% target, and officials have said they need to see further evidence of the economy cooling.\nâIf we continue to see a cooling labor market and inflation heading back to our target, we can hold interest rates steady and let the effects of policy continue to work,â San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said earlier this month. âImportantly, even if we hold rates where they are today, policy will grow increasingly restrictive as inflation â and inflation expectations â fall.â\nHowever, the US job market remains on strong footing. Employers added a robust 336,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate held at a low 3.8% that month. Meanwhile, a separate report showed that job openings unexpectedly surged to 9.6 million in August.\nEconomic headwinds\nIn addition to soaring Treasury yields cooling the economy, dwindling savings accounts, fatigue from high inflation, the resumption of student loan payments this month and even the uncertainty around ongoing labor strikes could ultimately break the US consumer.\nNew concerns have surfaced around the war between Israel and Hamas, which could roil energy markets if the conflict escalates to disrupt the Middle East. So far, however, investors have mostly shrugged off the conflict.\nFor now, most economists agree the US economy will likely be spared a downturn this year. Bets of a 2023 US recession have collapsed and gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economy output, was likely robust in the July-through-September period, based on strong economic data in recent months. The Commerce Department reports third-quarter GDP next week.\nOn top of a strong labor market, retail sales rose in September for the sixth-straight month while US industrial production rose in September to its highest level in nearly five years.\nOne theme of the US economy this year has been resilience, but that sturdiness will certainly be put to the test in the coming months.\nâ CNNâs Elisabeth Buchwald and Nicole Goodkind contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Who can afford to go green? Hard-pressed consumers are pushing back\nAnalysis by Hanna Ziady, CNN\nLondon (CNN) — âAll the rich can afford a new car,â an elderly British woman commented at a recent protest in London against plans to expand a toll on older, polluting vehicles to outer suburbs of the city. âItâs affecting so many poor peopleâ¦ Everybody wants clean air but itâs all about money,â she told Times Radio.\nHer comments encapsulate growing resistance to pro-climate measures because of the costs they can impose on already stretched household budgets or the hassle they add to daily lives.\nMany people have seen their incomes eroded over the past 18 months by soaring food and energy bills and high borrowing costs. Even among those who accept that climate action is needed, rising numbers are unwilling or unable to shoulder additional expenses in these circumstances.\nâAcross Europe, a backlash against net-zero policy is underway,â Brett Meyer and Tone Langengen at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a think tank, wrote in August.\nNet-zero policy refers to measures to reduce planet-heating pollution. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis â in other words, after accounting for emissions released into and removed from the atmosphere â to avoid catastrophic climate change.\nâWhile polls show that an overwhelming majority believe climate change is a problem and support policies to address it, that support starts to fall once green policies come into force and people begin to experience their costs,â Langengen and Meyer said.\nWhy public attitudes matter\nTake two recent opinion polls. In a 2022Â Pew surveyÂ covering 19 countries in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, climate change was named the top global threat. In Europe, more respondents said it was a threat to their country than at any time in the past two decades.\nâThe results come as wildfires and extreme heat across Europe cause massive disruption to life,â the Pew researchers wrote in August last year, before another bout of deadly wildfires ravaged Greece this summer.\nYet, in aÂ surveyÂ earlier this year conducted in 29 countries by Ipsos, only 30% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more in taxes to help prevent climate change.\nPublic attitudes âmatter a lotâ for reaching net-zero emissions because of the fundamental changes the transition will require, said Anna Valero, a distinguished policy fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).\nâWhat weâre talking about is large-scale structural change that will affect peopleâs lives,â she told CNN. From the way they heat their homes and the cars they drive, to the skills they need to do the jobs necessary for the transition, everything is in flux.\nSince citizensÂ are voters, consumers and workers, they will âdetermine the feasibility of different things,â she added. âThereâs a limit to what policymakers can do if the public donât support their program. And thereâs a limit to what businesses will do if the consumers wonât purchase those more environmentally sustainable options.â\nOne of the most high-profile options is to switch to an electric car. But consumer demand is already waning.\nEarlier this month, the CEO of Volkswagen, Oliver Blume, cited a âsluggish ramp-upâ of the electric vehicle (EV) market in Europe as a reason for the carmakerâs decision not to build additional battery factories for now, beyond the three plants it is already planning. âThere is for the time being no business rationale for deciding on further sites,â he said in a statement.\nSales data compiled by HSBC shows that carmakers in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States are having to offer discounts and cheap financing to counter weaker-than-expected demand for EVs.\nâIn the UK, not only are the discounts on the rise, the activity seems to be spreading to more brands,â the bankâs auto analysts wrote in a note last month.\nBackpedaling by policymakers doesnât help. In September, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak watered down the governmentâs climate strategy,Â delaying a banÂ on the sale of new gas and diesel cars by five years among other changes.\nFord (F), which had hoped the governmentâs earlier timeline would boost demand for EVs, was sharply critical of Sunakâs decision to push it out to 2035.\nSustained discounting may be needed to encourage more motorists around the world to switch to EVs. For example, in the United States, going electric still means paying a premium over the typical gas-powered model: the average price of a new EV was $51,762 in October compared with $47,936 across all vehicles, according to auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.\nâThere is no trade-offâ\nBut high upfront costs mask the fact that climate-friendly products such as EVs and heat pumps will likely save consumers money down the line.\nThe UK governmentâs own independent adviser on climate strategy, the Climate Change Committee, said delaying the ban on gas-guzzling cars is likely to increase motoring costs for households.\nâElectric vehicles will be significantly cheaper than petrol and diesel vehicles to own and operate over their lifetimes, so any undermining of their rollout will ultimately increase costs,â the committee wrote in a report last month.\nThe same is true of heat pumps. These use electricity to transfer heat from a source, such as the air or ground, and are standard in Scandinavian countries including Norway and Sweden, which have bitter winters.\nBecause of their energy efficiency, heat pumps would reduce the average UK householdâs heating bill by 25% and slash the average homeâs carbon emissions by 75%, according to Swedish heat pump firm Aira.\nâThere is no trade-off between (installing a heat pump), saving the planet and at the same time saving the pockets of consumers,â CEO Martin Lewerth told CNN.\nA heat pump is around three toÂ sevenÂ times more expensive than a typical boilerÂ powered by natural gasÂ when accounting for both its price and the installation cost. In Britain, even the more generous Â£7,500 ($9,400) government grant that Sunak unveiled in September wonât fully offset the difference in many cases.\nThe limited number of engineers able to install and service heat pumps is another hindrance, and also adds to costs.\nâIf youâre living outside Scandinavia and you want a heat pump, itâs not a hassle-free experience,â Lewerth acknowledged. To address these challenges, Aira, which launched in the UK Monday, is offering monthly payment plans. The firm is also opening âAira Academiesâ across Europe to retrain gas boiler installers and turn them into âclean energy experts.â\nâReplacing one gas boiler with an electric heat pump will basically mean taking two (combustion engine) cars off the street,â Lewerth said. âOnce people understand this is actually cheaper and a better solutionâ¦ then itâs self-propelling.â\nThe cost of delay\nConversely, delaying the implementation of net-zero measures at a time when scientists say climate action needs to be accelerated will hit consumersâ pockets harder in the long run â and cost the planet dearly.\nâThere is no scenario in which delay is the cheaper option with climate change,â said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE.\nâThe cost of the transition, while significant, is nowhere near the cost of dealing with the consequences (of climate change).â\nIn the first six months of 2023, economic losses from natural disasters, which scientists say are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of climate change, amounted to $120 billion, according to insurer Swiss Re. Thatâs 46% above the first-half average over the previous 10 years.\nIn the United States alone, extreme weather events cost the economy close to $150 billion a year and disproportionately affect poor and disadvantaged communities, according to the government. And that estimate doesnât account for loss of life or health care-related costs.\nBeyond the economic damage from climate change, there is also a hefty price tag associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels, including natural gas â as was painfully demonstrated by the spike in European energy bills as a result of the war in Ukraine.\nâIf weâd invested more in renewable energyâ¦ energy bills wouldnât have gone up so much, which disproportionately impacted on poor households,â Valero at the LSE told CNN.\nIn a similar vein, cleaner air can have economic benefits. A 2020 study by the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, concluded that expanding Londonâs Ultra Low Emission Zone â the target of the recent protest in London â would meaningfully boost workforce participation and productivity by improving peopleâs health.\nSo itâs clear that weaning economies off fossil fuels, while costly and disruptive in the short term, will deliver substantial returns in the long run.\nThe job of governments, then, is to ensure that the upfront costs of reaching net zero do not fall on the poor, even if that means that âat some point rich people have to pay more,â according to Tim Jackson, the director of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey in the UK.\nâWe have to think about where the burden of that cost falls now,â he told CNN. âItâs clear it shouldnât fall on the poorest. That means that if there are costsâ¦ even if these are investment costs with returns later on, then to some extent they should fall on people who can afford to pay them.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "DOJ ramps up its allegations that Texas is ‘judge-shopping’ in cases against Biden\nBy Tierney Sneed, CNN\nThe Justice Department is tripling down on its allegations that Texas is “judge-shopping” in the lawsuits the state has brought against the Biden administration.\nBut the department is running into headwinds as it tries to push back against the Lone Star State’s pattern of filing cases in a way that allows it to effectively choose the judges that hear them.\nAt a hearing last week on a Justice Department request that one such case — a challenge to a Biden immigration policy — be transferred to another federal court, the judge seemed to dismiss DOJ’s concerns and appeared to blame the department for creating any perception that the case assignment set up was unfair.\nThe judge, US District Judge Drew Tipton, is one of three judges presiding over cases where DOJ has called out Texas for funneling its litigation against the Biden administration to courthouses — often in remote parts of the state — where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned most or all of the cases.\nWith its tactics, Texas can “circumvent the random assignment system by never filing in Divisions where they have a non-trivial chance of not knowing what judge they are likely to be assigned,” the DOJ said in brief submitted to Tipton this week.\nPrivate litigants have been accused of taking advantage of the system as well — with perhaps the most high-profile example being a lawsuit by anti-abortion activists seeking to block the FDA’s approval of a drug used in medication abortions, the most common method of terminating a pregnancy. The case is before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who has issued controversial rulings against the Biden administration in the past and who is all but guaranteed to hear cases filed in the Amarillo division, where the medication abortion lawsuit was brought.\nThe DOJ asked Kacsmaryk last month to transfer a separate, Texas-brought lawsuit against the administration — a challenge to climate change-related regulations for investors — to another district. On Monday the department filed a similar request with another Trump-appointee, Judge James Wesley Hendrix, in a case Texas filed that takes aim at the annual federal spending bill that Biden signed late last year.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office denies it’s done anything improper in where it has filed cases.\n“There are numerous compelling reasons for these cases to be heard where they are filed,” Paige Wiley, a Paxton spokesperson, told CNN in an email. She accused the Biden administration of “perpetuating” a “baseless smear” of judge-shopping that “risks undermining the public’s trust in the legal system.”\nTexas and private conservative activists have had a remarkable success rate in securing court orders that block nationwide major Biden agenda items — often in lawsuits filed in divisions where a particular judge is guaranteed to hear the case. When those judges’ orders are appealed, they go to the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country.\nForum shopping is a strategy embraced by litigants on the left and the right. Progressives were strategic in where they brought cases against the Trump administration. But legal experts say there’s a distinction between the practice then and the current trends, because with the Trump-era cases, those lawsuits were filed in courthouses where one of several Democratic-appointed judges could be assigned the case.\nTipton, however, seemed largely unconcerned with Texas’ tactics of targeting its cases at his courtroom, as he grilled a DOJ attorney on whether the department was suggesting the judge would be unfair.\nTipton told the DOJ attorney, Erez Reuveni, that the department could help with the perception of fairness by saying on the public record that it believed that Tipton, as a judge, would give them a fair shake.\n“Wouldn’t that go a long way to addressing any public perception issues?” Tipton said, according to a transcript of the hearing.\nA record of wins for Texas\nPaxton’s office has brought 28 cases against the Biden administration in Texas federal courts, according to a DOJ brief, which said that all of those lawsuits have been filed “in just seven Divisions where local rules severely limit the number of judges to whom the cases could be assigned.” Eighteen of those cases were filed in divisions where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned all lawsuits, the DOJ has said.\nTipton presides over virtually all civil litigation filed in Victoria, Texas, including at least seven lawsuits brought by Paxton against the administration in that division. In one of those cases — concerning the how the administration prioritizes deportations — Tipton in 2021 halted the policy and ordered regular updates from the administration on how it was managing its deportations in accordance with his order.\nThat case is now being reviewed by the US Supreme Court, which has kept the Biden policy on pause. Tipton was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is viewed as a very conservative judge, having been confirmed without the support of any Democrats.\nHendrix, another Trump appointee, hears two-thirds of the civil lawsuits filed in the Lubbock division, which is located in northwest Texas and is several hours’ drive from the state’s biggest cities. DOJ, with its Monday request in the spending legislation case, asked the judge to move the lawsuit to DC or to Austin. The department argued that Texas’ “sole allegation related to an event in Texas is the National Board’s award of a grant to a non-profit organization in Houston.”\nKacsmaryk, meanwhile, is assigned every civil case filed in Amarillo, another division in northern Texas. The judge has ruled in favor of Texas in disputes over Biden administration’s LGBT protections and the president’s attempts to end Trump-era migration restrictions. He is now in the national spotlight for his forthcoming ruling in the medication abortion case, which could be issued any day now.\nThe lead plaintiff in that case, a medical organization called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, filed its paperwork incorporating in Amarillo just a few months before filing the lawsuit. However, the organization’s attorney pushed back on allegations that the filing location was chosen strategically to get the case before Kacsmaryk.\n“It’s an utterly nonsensical argument to make because we have every right to file a lawsuit where our clients are injured,” Erik Baptist — a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the abortion pill challengers — told CNN. He pointed to an individual plaintiff in the lawsuit, Dr. Shaun Jester, who practices near Amarillo.\n“Congress has authorized the American public to sue federal agencies where the American public has actually been injured and where they reside,” Baptist said. “And that’s exactly what Dr. Jester did here. He filed this lawsuit with the other plaintiffs in this case because he is based in the Amarillo area, and therefore, we filed this lawsuit where he resides.”\nTexas defends its tactics\nTo explain why its lawsuits against the Biden administration often end up in single-judge divisions miles from the state capital, Texas is leaning on case law that says that states — when suing the federal government — reside in all parts of their borders and are not restricted to filing suits in the court divisions containing their state capitals.\nLeif Olson, an attorney in Paxton’s office, told Tipton at last week’s hearing that “I don’t know why our office chooses to file in seven divisions over and over,” referring to the seven divisions DOJ highlighted in its briefs.\nOlson told Tipton that the specific immigration case was filed in Victoria because Paxton’s office felt like it knew how the judge ran his court room and because Tipton was familiar with the statutes relevant to the case.\n“The long and short of it, Your Honor, is that the public interest is served by having the case decided fairly and quickly. That is available in the Victoria Division,” Olson said.\nReuveni, the DOJ attorney, meanwhile, stressed that their motion wasn’t targeted at Tipton, whom the department thought was a fair judge, but rather it was aimed at Texas’ tactics. Reuveni said that the department would have no issue if the case was randomly assigned to Tipton, having been transferred to a court division where Tipton shares case assignment with other judges.\nTipton, however, suggested DOJ was to blame for exacerbating any public perception of unfairness, and the judge highlighted his tendency of granting DOJ requests for pauses of his orders so they can be appealed.\nWhen pressed by the judge, Reuveni confirmed that the department believed that Tipton was impartial.\n“Don’t you think if the public heard the Department of Justice say that, that it would go a long way towards addressing your public perception concern?” the judge said.\nThe judge is expected to rule on the motion to transfer in the next few weeks.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Rupert Murdoch steps down as Fox and News Corp. chairman, sending shockwaves through media and politics\nCNN\nBy Oliver Darcy, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Rupert Murdoch, the powerful right-wing media mogul who built and oversaw one of the worldâs most influential news empires, announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of his companies, Fox Corporation and News Corporation.\nâFor my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change,â Murdoch, 92, wrote in a memo to employees. âBut the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams.â\nAs the leader of Fox and News Corporation, which publishes influential broadsheets such as The Wall Street Journal and tabloid New York Post, Murdoch has for decades commanded considerable influence in the Republican Party, matched by only a select few.\nHis retirement comes at a key moment in the media industry as entrenched entertainment giants confront a sweeping transformation of the traditional television and film business and consumers rapidly gravitate toward streaming services.\nMurdochâs decision to step down as chairman of his companies will also send shockwaves through the political world, just as the 2024 presidential race heats up. Fox News remains ensnared in litigation stemming from the networkâs peddling of former President Donald Trumpâs election lies in the wake of the 2020 election.\nLachlan Murdoch steps in\nStepping into his shoes, Murdochâs eldest son, Lachlan, who already serves as chief executive of Fox Corporation, will become sole chairman of both companies.\nMurdoch described Lachlan as âa passionate, principled leader.â Itâs unclear if Foxâs direction will change under Lachlan, but Rupert signaled that Lachlan will maintain the right-wing editorial bent his media companies are known for.\nâMy father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,â Murdoch told employees in his memo. âSelf- serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who would question their provenance and purpose. Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.â\nRupert Murdoch, who assured staffers he is in ârobust health,â said that in his new role as chairman emeritus he would still be âinvolved every day in the contest of ideas.â\nHowever, Lachlan Murdoch has privately criticized Trump, saying that he disagrees with much of the way the former President behaves, people familiar with the matter told CNN last year. In some comments, Murdoch had gone as far as to tell people that he believes if Trump were to run again, it would be bad for the country.\nA storied, controversial career\nMurdochâs foray into the media business began in the 1950s with a small Australian newspaper chain,\nIn 1969, Murdoch landed his first major overseas prize with the purchase of the UKâs News of the World. He went on to acquire The Sun and The Times and The Sunday Times of London, building a newspaper empire that gave him unrivaled reach and political influence in Britain.\nIn 1973, Murdoch first entered the United States media sphere with the purchase of the San Antonio Express and the San Antonio News. A year later, he moved to New York and soon after began the National Star, a tabloid competing against the National Enquirer.\nPerhaps one of his most prolific purchases was the New York Post in 1976, a punchy New York City tabloid that still dominates the media and political sphere today. Heâs owned it since then, except for a brief time when rules prohibited ownership of newspapers and TV stations in the same city. He bought it back in 1993 after selling it in 1988.\nMurdoch became a major Hollywood executive in 1985 when he purchased Twentieth Century Fox from oilman Marvin Davis for $600 million. In 1986, Murdoch got into the television business after he purchased several US television stations and created Fox Broadcasting.\nHe launched UK satellite pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 1989, before merging it with a major rival just a year later after a bruising price war.\nBut his UK empire foundered two decades later as a consequence of a hacking scandal at the News of the World.\nMurdoch shut the Sunday tabloid â one of Britainâs oldest and best-selling newspapers â in July 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that the outlet had illegally eavesdropped on murder and terror victims, politicians and celebrities. The scandal forced him to abandon a bid to take control of Sky.\nHe made another bid for the pay-TV broadcaster in 2016, but it became ensnared by UK media regulators who worried that the deal would give the Murdoch family too much influence in Britain and concerns over its commitment to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Comcast swooped in at the last minute and outbid Fox for Sky.\nAlthough he focused largely on print and TV, he did unsuccessfully try to dominate the internet too. He bought MySpace, one of the first social networks, in 2005 for $580 million. in 2011, he sold it for a substantial loss at $35 million. He later reflected that its failure was because of a âseries of expensive lost opportunitiesâ with an addition of a âlayer of bureaucracyâ that halted progress against rivals like Facebook and YouTube.\nMurdoch sold much of his media empire, including the Twentieth Century Fox film studio, to Disney in a massive $71 billion deal in 2019. He was left with a much leaner broadcast portfolio, consisting of Fox News and Fox Sports.\nAfter that sale, however, he maintained his News Corp. newspaper business, including the Wall Street Journal, which was part of his companyâs Dow Jones purchase in 2007 for $5.6 billion. Under his purview, the broadsheet expanded its focus beyond money and markets, built a successful paywall and kept its down-the-middle tone except for its conservative Opinion page.\nFox News\nFox News launched in 1996 as a conservative startup competitor to CNN. It eventually became the top cable news channel in America by playing into conservative narratives.\nThe channel, however, veered from its roots in conservative news as former President Donald Trump ascended to power in the Republican Party in 2015, becoming an unabashed home of right-wing propaganda aimed at propping up the scandal-ridden White House.\nMurdoch-owned outlets also have a long history of undermining and down-playing climate science. In the US, Fox News has become a home to climate change conspiracy theories and the people who proliferate them. While Murdoch has said many times that he does not support climate denial, his outlets have continued to push climate doubt and platform climate skeptics.\nâNobody has done more harm to the understanding of climate change than Rupert Murdoch, who has wielded his global media network as a weapon to sow doubt and confusion about the basic science and the case for action,â Michael Mann, a renowned climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN.\nIn recent years, under Murdoch, Fox News has advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.\nThe lies Fox News pushed about the election spawned two massive defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\nFox earlier this year settled the Dominion lawsuit for a historic $787.5 million. The Smartmatic lawsuit, however, continues to make its way through the court system.\nFox News announced Murdochâs retirement on its air Thursday morning, with anchor Bill Hemmer praising the networkâs founder.\nâRupert Murdoch created all of this and so much more across America and the globe,â Hemmer said. âHis lifeâs work has left an indelible imprint on the global media landscape. His contributions are both innumerable and extraordinary and we thank him for letting us be a part of it all.â\nâWithout him, we would not be here,â anchor Dana Perino added.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Billions of dollars in aid has been mobilized.\nYet the world is still in the grips of the worst food crisis in modern history, as Russia’s war in Ukraine shakes global agricultural systems already grappling with the effects of extreme weather and the pandemic. Market conditions may have improved in recent months, but experts do not expect imminent relief.\nThat means more pain for vulnerable communities already struggling with hunger. It also boosts the risk of starvation and famine in countries such as Somalia, which is contending with what the United Nations describes as a “catastrophic” food emergency.\n“All the major causes of the food crisis are still with us â conflict, Covid, climate change, high fuel prices,” Cary Fowler, the US special envoy for global food security, told CNN. “I do think we have to prepare for 2023 being a rough year.”\nThe issue is on the agenda as government and business leaders head to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. It will vie for attention as attendees discuss topics ranging from energy costs and maintaining global security to artificial intelligence and demographic shifts.\nDavid Beasley, head of the UN’s World Food Programme, tweeted that the elite gathering comes at a “critical time.” His agency received $14 billion in 2022, an unprecedented sum that included more than $7 billion from the United States. That helped it deliver food and assistance to about 160 million people.\nBut high food prices mean that funding can’t go as far, and Russia’s war continues to generate volatility. More work also needs to be done to boost supplies of food in countries with greater needs.\n“The ranks of the food insecure are growing faster than our ability to provide humanitarian assistance,” Fowler said. “We can’t get out of this crisis by supplying food aid.”\nThe highest food prices on record\nBefore Russia invaded Ukraine, the price of food was already at its highest level in a decade due to scrambled supply chains and extreme weather events, such as the worst drought in almost a century in central and southern Brazil. Record prices for natural gas â a key input to make nitrogen-based fertilizers â had also become a nightmare for farmers.\nThen came the war. Ukraine normally supplies about 45 million metric tons of grain to the global market every year and is the world’s top exporter of sunflower oil. Together with Russia, it accounted for about one quarter of global wheat exports in 2019. As Russian troops blockaded the country’s ports, the strained food system was dealt another shock â this one even harder to bear.\n“The Ukraine crisis has had this ongoing negative impact on world food prices and [added] even more volatility,” said Abby Maxman, CEO of Oxfam America. “The supply chains and how they flow to places like East Africa and the Horn of Africa are taking big hits.”\nThat drove the Food Price Index developed by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization to its highest annual level on records dating back to 2005, rising more than 14% compared to 2021. In 2022, the number of people grappling with acute food insecurity â meaning their access to food was so restricted that it threatened their lives and livelihoods â shot up to 345 million from 135 million in 2019.\nThere have been some signs of improvement. The index has dropped for nine consecutive months, and its December value was below that of one year ago.\nA big factor is the sharp decline in the price of vegetable oils. Supplies are high and demand is down as the economy slows and recession fears take hold. The deal to restart Ukraine’s food exports via the Black Sea allowed it to ship more than 12 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs through the beginning of December. And the falling price of energy has helped bring down the cost of fertilizer.\n“At the moment, things are trending in the right direction,” said Jonathan Haines, senior analyst at Gro Intelligence, a research firm.\nBut concerns remain, especially given that food prices appear to have stabilized at high levels.\nFertilizer remains expensive on a historical basis, and farmers have been using less to conserve costs; that could reduce crop yields in upcoming harvests. China’s rapid rollback of coronavirus restrictions means the country’s demand for agricultural products could suddenly skyrocket, lifting prices again. Plus, Ukrainian and US officials have said Russia is slow-walking inspections of ships loaded with grain at Black Sea ports, leading to backups and costly delays.\nRussia “is not assisting in alleviating the food crisis in slowing down the grain inspections,” Fowler said.\nUnpredictable and extreme weather also poses a risk after the eight warmest years on record. The past 12 months saw unprecedented heat in Europe, devastating flooding in Pakistan, dryness in the US corn belt and severe drought in South America linked to the La NiÃ±a phenomenon.\n“We’ve been experiencing a lot of climate disruption,” Haines said. “It’s a big unknown.”\nThe far-reaching costs of war\nUpheaval in the global food market has added to the ranks of poor and hungry people around the world, and those monitoring conditions are worried about the future.\n“We really are in a moment where we’re seeing increasing poverty because of all these shocks, particularly in Africa,” said Dina Esposito, USAID’s global food crisis coordinator, who is traveling with Fowler to Malawi and Zambia this week.\nGovernments, still stung by the pandemic, have less bandwidth to provide assistance, especially given the rapid run-up in interest rates â which mandates heftier debt payments â and the strong US dollar, which makes importing food more expensive. Agricultural prices in local currency have gone up 142% in Malawi and 120% in Zambia since the start of 2020, according to an analysis from Gro Intelligence.\nMeanwhile, countries already on the brink, such as drought-stricken Somalia, have been pushed further to the edge. Aid groups have estimated that more than 90% of wheat consumed in the country comes from Russia and Ukraine. Oxfam’s Maxman, who traveled there in September, said disruptions to food supplies were obvious in markets.\nLast summer, a senior nutrition manager at a clinic run by the International Rescue Committee in Mogadishu told CNN that its caseload had spiked 80% in one month, and that it was seeing a staggering 265% increase in severe malnutrition in children under the age of five.\n“It’s the compounding effects that’s hurting those least responsible for what’s happening the most,” Maxman said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "‘We’re still on the bunny slopes’: As 2023 kicks off, is Canada’s climate change plan aggressive enough?\nBy Alexandra Mae Jones\nClick here for updates on this story\nToronto (CTV Network) — Last year, we received a dire warning from climate scientists that the world needs to make more decisive changes in order to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts – but as 2023 gets off the ground, is Canada doing everything it can to secure our future?\nThe federal government spent 2022 reiterating its commitment to lowering emissions and battling climate change, launching new programs and ironing out details for its plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBut details are still lacking on several points, including whether Canada will actually meet its promise to phase out “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies by 2023, and some experts say we need to be moving more confidently.\n“The irony is, under the current government, we have the most comprehensive and aggressive climate policies that Canada has ever had,” Simon Donner, a climate scientist and professor at the University of British Columbia, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.\n“The problem is, even what we’ve initiated at the federal level is still not nearly enough. We’ve got everything from carbon pricing to mandates for the sale of electric vehicles, they’re passing a mandate to make all electricity zero-carbon, there’s a whole bunch of incentives and investment programs. But none of it is happening fast enough. And none of it is strong enough to really accelerate emissions reductions.”\nClimate Barometer newsletter: Sign up to keep your finger on the climate pulse In April of 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) released a report slamming governments for their inaction on climate change, stating that to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, world leaders need to be making drastic moves to reduce emissions now, instead of tentative plans.\nThe report, which found that humanity is “firmly on track toward an unlivable world,” outlined how, as a whole, current government timelines for reducing emissions simply aren’t sufficient to limit warming to the 2015 Paris agreement’s goal of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\nCanada was noted in the IPCC report as one of the highest per-capita emissions producers among developed countries, alongside Australia and the United States.\n“The report reminded governments of what they do know, that climate change is real, we’re feeling the effects around the world, and we are not taking action nearly fast enough,” Donner said. “The world’s greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing.”\nThe federal government has pledged a combined $10.7 billion in new funding in 2022 across two new plans: Canada’s National Adaptation Strategy, first announced in December 2020 and released in November, which aims to help us adapt to climate impacts such as extreme weather; and the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, which lays out how Canada will achieve the 2030 target of reducing emissions to 40-45 per cent below 2005 emission levels.\n“It is unequivocal that Canada’s climate has changed and will continue to change,” Environment and Climate Change Canada told CTVNews.ca in an emailed statement that laid out their climate plans introduced in 2022.\n“The Government of Canada must keep fighting climate change but must also be better prepared for the changes Canada is already seeing and adapt to those changes that are here to stay.”\nThe plans have the right bones, Donner said, but he’s not convinced it’ll be enough.\n“We have the right framework here in Canada,” he said. “I think of it as, like, we’ve got our skis, we’ve got our equipment and we’ve been trained, yet, we’re staying on the bunny slopes rather than using all that skills and equipment and going down a black diamond [slope].”\nLINGERING QUESTIONS ON GOAL TO PHASE OUT ‘INEFFICIENT’ SUBSIDIES BY 2023 In November, Canada said it would cease new support for international fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022, a step forward that was lauded by environmental advocates.\nIn 2009, Canada pledged, along with other G20 countries, to “rationalize or phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” and in 2021 accelerated its timeline to eliminate these domestic subsidies by 2025 to 2023.\nBut what exactly does this mean?\nThe government did not directly respond to CTVNews.ca‘s request for a definition of “inefficient” in the context of fossil fuel subsidies.\nInstead, it reiterated the G20 Leaders Statement from 2009 that committed countries to “phase out … inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption,” and specified that “this reform will not apply to our support for clean energy, renewables and technologies that dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”\nA transcript from an appearance before the standing committee on climate change in March 2022 seems to shed a bit more light on the question, stating that the G20 commitment “intentionally [contains] no definition of ‘inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,’ so that countries can define this term in the context of their national circumstances.”\nIt does not clarify how Canada defines this term in the context of our national circumstances.\nCanada has phased out eight tax preferences for the fossil fuel sector as part of the G20 commitment so far, including phasing out accelerated capital cost allowance for oil sands by 2015, phasing out the accelerated capital cost allowance for mining by 2021 and phasing out a tax preference for small oil and gas companies to reclassify department expenses as exploration expenses by 2019.\nThe government also told CTVNews.ca that Canada is undergoing a peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidy reform under the G20 process to identify and reduce fossil fuel subsidies.\nHowever, this isn’t news – the peer review has been ongoing since 2018, with the final report still nowhere in sight.\nSix other G20 countries have already completed their peer reviews. It generally took around one to two years for those reviews, compared to Canada’s four years and counting.\nDonner said that it makes little sense to drag our heels on eliminating subsidies within Canada while ending them outside of Canada.\n“We’re going to eliminate it internationally but continue it at home. And those two things are not very compatible,” he said.\n“I would like to just see, ‘eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies,’ full stop, and remove the word ‘inefficient.’”\nSome things that could be classified as fossil fuel subsidies don’t contribute to oil and gas projects themselves, he explained, but might still fall under that umbrella, such as the government giving an oil company funding to clean up abandoned oil wells.\nIt would make more sense to add exceptions on a case-by-case basis after making a commitment to eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies rather than hashing out what “inefficient” means first, he said.\nAlthough fossil fuels are a huge contributor to emissions in Canada – in 2019, the oil and gas sector made up more than a quarter of our total emissions – it’s not straightforward to move away from them.\n“The biggest challenge right now, I think we have it nationally, is about what we do about our reliance on oil and gas extraction and production as an industry,” Donner said.\nAt COP27 this past fall, Canada wouldn’t back the inclusion of language calling for the phaseout of all fossil fuels, which would include oil and gas, with Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault saying that the federal government would receive too much pushback from provinces if they backed such a commitment.\nIt’s a weak argument, Julia Levin, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, told The Canadian Press in November.\n“I’d say it’s clear that the government of Canada is beholden to fossil fuel lobbyists and putting their interests ahead of public welfare,” Levin said.\nBut Guilbeault’s caution may not be unfounded. At a press conference Tuesday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith expressed her displeasure with COP27 discussing “shutting down the oil and gas industry the same way that coal had been phased out.”\nPROVINCIAL PUSHBACK ON CLIMATE PLANS The new year has barely begun, and already the federal government’s climate plans are causing friction.\nLast week, Smith took aim at the federal government’s plan to create “just transition legislation” in order to help displaced energy workers find new jobs in a net-zero future, stating that “oil and gas – and its thousands of byproducts – will be a part of the global economy for decades,” and that Alberta isn’t interested in Ottawa interfering in its industry.\nThe province has been enjoying a surge in production due to the lifting of global pandemic restrictions and the war in Ukraine, and experts are projecting that oil production will be even higher in 2023.\nBut continued reliance on oil and gas doesn’t match the needs of the future, scientists say. A report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) that came out last fall stated that there was a “large consensus” across published studies that developing new oil and gas fields is “incompatible” in terms of achieving the 2015 Paris agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, echoing the findings of the International Energy Agency (IEA) the year prior.\nAfter the release of the IPCC report in April, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned governments and corporations that are continuing to invest in fossil fuels and develop new fossil fuel projects.\n“Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness,” he said at the time.\nEven if Canada ends all federal fossil fuel subsidies, that doesn’t mean there will be no public money going towards these projects – provincial subsidies play a huge role in the fossil fuel industry.\nAccording to an IISD report published in February, the four main fossil-fuel producing provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador provided at least $4 billion in fossil fuel subsidies between 2020 and December 2021.\nIn May 2022, B.C. announced that it would be changing its decades-old royalty system for oil and gas firms and eliminating its deep well royalty program, its largest fossil fuel subsidy.\nAlberta alone provided around $1.98 billion in fossil fuel subsidies between 2020 and the end of 2021, doubling down on the oil and gas sector as a strategy to recover from COVID-19’s economic blow.\nBut according to Donner, IEA models are projecting a decrease in demand for oil and gas globally over the next few decades, “particularly from Canada, for Canadian products.”\nThe problem is that, geographically speaking, it’s more costly to produce some oil and gas products in Canada compared to other countries, Donner said, meaning potentially diminishing returns as demand lessens and focus shifts to alternative energy sources.\nOn the economic side of things, “we could end up in some really costly dead ends,” Donner said.\nHe added that emissions “disproportionately” come from Alberta.\n“But, for understandable reasons, it’s not easy to convince the Government of Alberta and many Albertans that they should change, transition from this industry that has sustained so much growth in the province for so long,” he said.\n“They’re basically betting against climate action. Because if you’re saying there’s going to be increased demand for Canadian oil gas products over the next 30 years, moving towards 2050, all of the modelling says that only happens in the world where we don’t deal with climate change.”\nHe acknowledged that he is speaking from the bird’s-eye view of someone whose livelihood isn’t affected by these decisions.\nIt’s understandable that for many people, criticism of the oil and gas industry can feel threatening, and that’s what makes it so important to invest in training and jobs and prepare people for an inevitable transition in how we think about energy, he said.\n“The world is serious about shifting to renewable energies,” he said. “If we don’t take the transition seriously, people in oil and gas dependent places are going to suffer. The longer we put off the transition, the harder it’s going to be.”\nDOES CANADA NEED TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS? Donner, who serves on the Net-Zero Advisory Body with other independent scientists to give the government advice on how to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, said Canada’s plan hits all the right beats, but isn’t pressing hard or fast enough.\n“We have a federal carbon price … but it doesn’t increase to $107 a tonne until 2030,” he said.\n“We have support to help people buy electric vehicles. But it’s not in every province. We have initiatives to encourage people to put zero emissions heat pumps in their home to replace their furnaces, but it’s not enough money. And there’s not enough training for people to install. We have kind of all of the knowledge and the skills and even the framework or the policies, we just need the guts to implement them stronger.”\nOne example of where we could be doing more is in how we heat buildings, Donner said.\nNot only are buildings one of the largest sources of emissions in Canada, but insufficient cooling or heating systems can be fatal when severe weather strikes. When hundreds died in B.C. during a heat wave in 2021, a huge contributing factor was that a vast majority of homes there do not have air conditioning.\nInstead of separate furnaces and air conditioners, a push for heat pumps or district energy systems could make buildings more prepared for heat waves while lowering emissions, Donner suggested.\nDistrict energy systems provide heating and cooling to a number of buildings within a concentrated geographic area, such as a university campus or a neighbourhood, meaning the ability to lower emissions all at once for many buildings by switching to less-carbon intensive fuel. Heat pumps for individual homes use thermal energy drawn from the environment to repurpose it for both heating and cooling. Both are considered greener options for buildings.\nBut while the Canada Greener Homes Initiative offers homeowners a grant of up to $5,000 for installing a heat pump in their home, you must go through a licensed and trained professional to receive the grant, and not many contractors are licensed to install them, Donner said.\n“Another approach that that we could use, policy-wise, is to incentivize contractors, building contractors, provide free training, and provide incentives to them,” he said.\nIf contractors have been trained to provide this service, they will be able to offer it to customers who otherwise wouldn’t have thought to ask because they’d never heard of it.\n“It’s similar to like, if we want to encourage electric vehicles, we both have to convince people to buy them, we also have to get the companies to build.”\nBUILDING A BETTER FUTURE One of the big issues is that there’s a “temporal disconnect” when we’re thinking about climate change, Donner said.\n“Politically, governments have to make decisions on things that they’re not going to see the benefits of in the short term. And also, governments have to make decisions that they might not see the benefits of within their jurisdiction.”\nIt’s difficult to change the systems we rely on when we can’t see positive impacts right away, he said. The key is to figure out what incentives we can create today that will provide the short-term benefit needed to spur long-term change.\n“This is about investing in the future. It’s not just about fighting climate change, it’s about making a better future for ourselves,” Donner said.\n“The future in which we’ve dramatically reduced emissions is one in which people are healthier. The environment is healthier. And life is, on average, cheaper. But we have to invest to make that happen. It takes upfront investment of money and effort to get to that place. And what I’ve learned this year is we’re chipping away at it, but we’re just not getting it – we’re still on the bunny slopes, we need to get onto those black diamonds.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

        "story_text": "Hurricane damage will increase in surprising new places in the coming decades. See where it’s trending higher\nBy Ella Nilsen and Renée Rigdon, CNN\nAs the planet warms, hurricanes are changing — they are getting stronger faster, bringing more flooding rain, pushing farther inland after they make landfall and tracking farther north in general.\nThose changes are exposing more people and properties to hurricanes’ damaging winds, according to a new report from nonprofit organization First Street Foundation — with the potential to cause millions of dollars in damage in the coming decades.\nImportantly, the report lays out how homeowners’ financial loss from hurricane damage is likely to increase significantly in surprising new places, including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\nThe First Street analysis, which covers the next 30 years — or the typical life of a home mortgage — shows Florida and the Gulf Coast will continue to have the largest magnitude of financial loss from hurricane damage. But the future holds a significant uptick in damage for regions that previously have tended to be safer from the most devastating storms.\nFor instance, First Street found the top 20 US cities with the highest likelihood of being hit with a major hurricane in 2023 are all in Florida. Over the next 30 years, though, New York City would see the largest percentage increase in average annual loss due to strong hurricanes, followed by Newport News, Virginia, and other coastal communities in the Mid-Atlantic. The report also highlights Southeast cities like Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, as notable future hot spots.\n“Hurricanes are making their way northward. They’re making it latitudinally up to places they haven’t before,” said Matthew Eby, founder and CEO of the First Street Foundation. “The second thing that comes along with that is they’re stronger.”\nFirst Street is known for analyzing flood risk that comes from more rainfall, rising seas and higher storm surge, but Eby said the group also wanted to capture how many properties were at risk to increased wind damage from stronger storms fueled by climate change — and where in the US they were.\n“We had half the story that comes from hurricanes with our flood model,” Eby said. “The other half of the story with hurricanes is the tremendous amount of wind force they have.”\nStorms moving farther north and inland\nHuman-caused climate change — which is warming the oceans and atmosphere — isn’t producing more hurricanes. But scientists have long said that it provides more fuel for stronger storms.\nThe probability of a hurricane in the North Atlantic strengthening into a major storm — a category 3 or higher — has increased from 10% in the 1980s to 40% today, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n“The odds of it being a major hurricane when it makes landfall are almost 50-50 now,” Eby told CNN. Even after it makes initial landfall, stronger and more-intact storms can persist longer over land, where they can dump incredible amounts of rain and bring high wind speeds to areas that aren’t prepared for them.\nFirst Street’s report also finds it more likely that hurricanes can form farther north, where communities are typically less resilient to hurricane-force winds than Miami or other Florida cities who are no stranger to these dangerous storms.\n“The South Carolina and Georgia border is where you’ll see the largest increase in wind speeds over the next 30 years,” Eby said.\nCharleston was hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016; though the storm was just a category 1, its storm surge was significant for the South Carolina coast, pushing water levels 3 to 5 feet above normal. But it hasn’t had a truly devastating storm since Hurricane Hugo slammed into the city in 1989 as a category 4 with 140-mph winds and became the costliest disaster on record at the time.\nThe area around the Georgia-South Carolina border has largely been spared from the worst hurricane landfalls because of the way the coastline bends inward. Most major hurricanes that strengthen in the Gulf of Mexico or warm waters of the Caribbean will hit another coast first — usually Florida.\nBut that could change as storms strengthen farther north in the Atlantic.\nHurricane models from prominent meteorologist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Kerry Emanuel, which First Street used in its report, also show current and future hurricanes having a “tendency to form a little bit north in the Atlantic,” Emanuel told CNN.\nThe problem, Emanuel and Eby said, is that stronger and more northward storms could be slamming into areas that haven’t yet established resiliency to hurricanes.\nThe increase in hurricane wind speeds for Florida “will be fairly mild compared to the increases in the mid-Atlantic states and New England,” Emanuel told CNN. “In Miami, 100 mph wind is serious but not devastating because they’re used to it.”\nAssessing risk\nThe problem with many hurricane models used by the government, insurance companies and banks to assess risk is that they’re out of date and lack sufficient historical data, according to Emanuel.\n“The bottom line is the models that are being used by the existing [catastrophe] modeling industry are based strictly on historical statistics,” Emanuel told CNN. “The historical record isn’t very long, and it isn’t very good when you get back to before 1970.”\nThe other issue is that hurricane models aren’t good at taking climate change into account. Emanuel developed his own physics-based model of present and future hurricanes that has tracked recent major storms accurately and which First Street used to create its report.\n“This is a big deal for the insurance companies, and they’ve woken up recently to this,” Emanuel said. “The estimates of risk they use to price properties and premiums are 50 years out of date, and the climate has changed enough to make their data useless.”\nPart of First Street’s design is to provide this data for individual homeowners to help make their homes safer and more resilient to storms. But Eby and Emanuel said they hope it is also used by the government and financial and insurance companies to either make communities more resilient or move them to areas that are safer.\n“We’re really hopeful that our data can do that, to have the risk illuminated for them to make the right decisions,” Eby said. “Now they’re armed with that data, they can make those smart decisions. That’s really the hope.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

        "story_text": "Insurance premiums could surge in these American cities because of climate disasters, new data shows\nBy Ella Nilsen and Krystina Shveda, CNN\n(CNN) — Millions of American homeowners could see insurance rates surge in the coming years in part due to worsening climate disasters, new data shows.\nAn analysis of from nonprofit research group First Street Foundation found nearly 39 million homes and commercial properties â about 27% of properties in the Lower 48 â are at risk of their premiums spiking as insurers struggle to cover the increasing cost of rebuilding after disasters.\nItâs another alarming sign for the future of Americaâs homeownersâ insurance market. In the last few years, major insurers have pulled out of or stopped writing new policies in California, Florida and Louisiana â in part citing increased climate risks like more destructive wildfires and stronger hurricanes.\nBut while insurance prices have already surged in those states, First Street found itâs still growing in other places we think of as less risky.\nâThis is not just isolated to particular areas of the country, but also will impact other areas that we traditionally might not think of,â said David Jones, the former California insurance commissioner and director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeleyâs Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, who was not involved in the analysis.\nThe insurance industry is only just beginning to price the cost of climate change into its premiums, said Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications at First Street and one of the reportâs lead authors.\nâWeâre still kind of at the forefront of the insurance industry pricing in climate risk into the real estate market,â Porter told CNN. âThe insurance companies are going to continue to respond to the increasing climate damages.â\nFor homeowners, this also means fewer choices between companies as private insurers pull out of high-risk areas or restrict coverage.\nNearly 7 million properties, almost 1 in 20 buildings, have already experienced price surges or have been dropped by insurance companies, First Street found. The majority of those properties are located either in wildfire and flood-prone California, or hurricane-prone Florida, Louisiana and Texas.\nBut this problem is growing nationwide. Jones pointed to recent extreme flooding that inundated Vermont this summer â dumping up to 9 inches in some parts of the state over two days and submerging the stateâs capital of Montpelier. Kentucky and West Virginia have been struck with deadly and costly flooding from massive rainstorms that combined with steep terrain to overwhelm small streams and creeks.\nâItâs hard to identify a part of the country that thatâs not impacted or wonât be impacted,â Jones told CNN. âAnd itâs only going to get worse.â\nSurging premiums\nEvery property in more than 1 in 10 American cities is at risk of premium spikes because of climate disasters, according to an analysis of the First Street data. These include places in states where insurers have already started to pull out, including Miami, Jacksonville and New Orleans.\nOutside of California, Florida and Louisiana, there are also cities where all properties are vulnerable to sudden price adjustments, mainly along the East Coast where hurricane risk is high and sea level is rising, the data shows â including Atlantic City, New Jersey; Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia; Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; and Savannah, Georgia.\nPremiums are at risk of surging to a lesser extent in cities across the country, First Street data shows.\nProperties in 4 out of 5 cities in the Lower 48 are vulnerable to rate hikes, including more than 25% of properties in New York City and Phoenix. In the Midwest, up to a fifth of homes in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Louisville and Cincinnati â susceptible to flooding rain and strong winds â are also at risk of premium adjustments. And on the West Coast, nearly all of Riverside, California, and a fifth of Los Angeles could see premiums spike.\nEven if these homes are not yet on the state-run insurer of last-resort â to which they typically pay higher premiums for a policy that covers less, âthey have the same risk profile,â Porter said.\nWhile this dynamic is just starting in the private insurance market, the price shocks already came for homeowners in the federal governmentâs flood insurance program. Premiums on federal flood insurance â known as the National Flood Insurance Program â increased significantly starting in 2021 as the federal government adjusted for the cost of stronger storms.\nThe most flood-prone areas of Gulf Coast states are set to get hit with rate increases especially hard as the plan is implemented over the next several years; in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, FEMA data shows its insurance premiums would go up 545% â from $842 to $5,431 per year. In Collier County, Florida â which was struck by Hurricane Ian last year â the increase was expected to be from around $1,050 per year to nearly $4,000.\nImplications beyond the insurance market\nThe math isnât working for some homeowners who have seen their premiums skyrocket.\nâWhen you see this huge spike â doubling, tripling, quadrupling of your insurance rate â all of a sudden those finances donât make sense to regular people,â he said.\nFaced with higher premiums, some homeowners who donât carry a mortgage are choosing to forgo insurance altogether â leaving them unprotected if a disaster hits, said Amy Bach, the executive director at United Policyholders, an insurance consumer-advocacy group.\nItâs hard to know exactly how many homeowners are choosing to âgo bareâ without insurance, Bach said, because she believes many arenât willing to self-report their choice. But her work with homeowners gives her a window into peoplesâ decisions.\nâI know where the places are where people are dropping their insurance â itâs Florida, Louisiana, California and Colorado,â Bach told CNN. âAnd soon thereâs going to be other places, because this is a national virus.â\nJones and Porter said there are larger economic implications down the road, when homeowners who have taken a higher premium try to sell their house and find they are short of buyers.\nJones said in parts of California that are prone to wildfires, there is already evidence that the lack of affordable insurance is impacting home prices.\nâIt stands to reason that if youâre a homebuyer, youâre going to ask the question, whatâs it going to cost me to insure this place, and can I get insurance?â Jones said.\nIf the answer is insurance is really expensive and hard to get, âthen homebuyers are saying, âIâm not going to pay as much for this house, because itâs simply not worth as much.ââ\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Biden to designate national monuments in Nevada, Texas\nBy MATTHEW DALY\nAssociated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is establishing national monuments in Nevada and Texas and creating a marine sanctuary in U.S. waters near the Pacific Remote Islands southwest of Hawaii.\nThe Democratic president is set to announce the measures Tuesday at a White House summit on conservation action at the Interior Department.\nBiden said in November that he intends to designate Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in southern Nevada that’s considered sacred to Native Americans, as a national monument. The site spans more than 500,000 acres (202,000 hectares) and includes Spirit Mountain, a peak northwest of Laughlin called Avi Kwa Ame (ah-VEE’ kwa-meh) by the Fort Mojave Tribe and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe rugged landscape near the Arizona and California state lines is home to bighorn sheep, desert tortoises and a large concentration of Joshua trees, some of which are more than 900 years old.\nIn Texas, Biden plans to create the Castner Range National Monument in El Paso. The designation will protect the cultural, scientific and historic objects found within the monument’s boundaries, honor U.S. veterans, service members and tribal nations, and expand access to outdoor recreation on public lands, the White House said.\nLocated on Fort Bliss, Castner Range served as a training and testing site for the U.S. Army during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Army ceased training at the site and closed Castner Range in 1966.\nTogether, the two new national monuments protect nearly 514,000 acres (208,000 hectares) of public lands.\nIn the Pacific, Biden will direct the Commerce Department to consider initiating a new national marine sanctuary designation within 30 days to protect all U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands. If completed, the new sanctuary would help ensure the U.S. reaches Biden’s goal to conserve at least 30% of ocean waters under U.S. jurisdiction by 2030, the White House said.\nBiden also will announce a series of steps to conserve, restore and expand access to public lands and waters across the country, the White House said. The proposals seek to modernize management of America’s public lands, harness the power of the ocean to help fight climate change, and better conserve wildlife corridors. Biden also will announce new spending to improve access to outdoor recreation, promote tribal conservation and reduce wildfire risk.\nBiden’s actions come as he faces sharp criticism from environmental groups and youth activists over his approval of the huge Willow oil drilling project in Alaska.\nBiden has made fighting global warming a central part of his agenda, and White House officials have defended efforts to put the United States on track to meet Biden’s goal to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\nBut the decision on Willow has alienated supporters, particularly young activists skeptical about political compromise at the same time Biden is planning to announce his reelection campaign.\nClimate activists are expected to gather outside the Interior Department on Tuesday to condemn what they call Biden’s “climate hypocrisy” and demand the administration change course on Willow.\nThe Willow Project has garnered global attention in recent weeks as a #stopwillow campaign went viral across social media platforms, most notably gaining more than 600 million views on TikTok and amassing more than 4 million signatures on a change.org petition, making it one of the most popular petitions in the website’s history.\nWhite House officials have acknowledged the indignation among Biden’s supporters over Willow but emphasized that oil giant ConocoPhillips has held leases in that area of Alaska for decades, which strengthens the Houston-based company’s legal right to drill.\nEnvironmental groups already have sued in a renewed effort to block Willow.\nConservation and tribal groups praised Biden’s action. The Avi Kwa Ame landscape is sacred to 12 tribes and is home to rare wildlife and plants, while Castner Range is the ancestral homeland of the Comanche and Apache people, and its cultural ecology is considered sacred to several Indigenous communities.\n“To the native people who point to Avi Kwa Ame as their spiritual birthplace, and every Nevadan who knows the value of our cherished public lands: Today is for you,″ tweeted Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, who sponsored a bill to protect the rugged region near the Mojave National Preserve from development, including solar farms and a proposed wind farm.\n“Spirit Mountain will now be protected for future generations,” Titus added.\nThe Castner Range monument “will preserve fragile lands already surrounded on three sides by development,” help ensure access to clean water and protect rare and endangered species, said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas.\nFort Mojave Tribe Chairman Timothy Williams, who is in Washington for the conservation summit, said designation of the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument is “a great example of the opportunity that exists when tribal, federal, state and local partners work together for conservation, restoration and stewardship solutions.\nThe Honor Avi Kwa Ame coalition, which includes tribes, local residents, state lawmakers and conservation groups, said its members were “overjoyed” to learn the site will be a new national monument.\n“Together, we will honor Avi Kwa Ame today — from its rich Indigenous history, to its vast and diverse plant and wildlife, to the outdoor recreation opportunities created for local cities and towns in southern Nevada by a new gorgeous monument right in their backyard,” the group said.\nBiden designated his first national monument, in Colorado, last year. In 2021, he restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah after they were significantly narrowed by President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Rio Yamat in Las Vegas contributed to this story.",

        "story_text": "California paves way for more insurance coverage in disaster-prone areas\nCheri Mossburg, CNN\n(CNN) — California will now let insurance companies consider climate change when offering policies, in exchange for a mandate requiring them to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas, state leaders announced on Thursday.\nâWe are at a major crossroads on insurance after multiple years of wildfires and storms intensified by the threat of climate change,â California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. âThe current system is not working for all Californians, and we must change course.â\nAs a result of several companies choosing to drop coverage in the state recently, consumers without options are flocking to the state-subsidized Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan.\nâThe FAIR plan has doubled to 3% of the market becoming the insurer of first resort for many Californians and not the last resort as it is intended to be,â Lara said Thursday at a news conference. âA growing FAIR plan is really a big problem for our state because the FAIR plan policyholders are required to pay more for less coverage and concentrating the highest risk properties under the FAIR plan increases the chance that they will be unable to afford a catastrophic disaster.â\nAn executive order issued by California Gov. Gavin Newsom clears the way for the new regulations.\nInsurance companies will give priority to homeowners and businesses who have taken steps to harden their properties to disasters like wildfires, floods and windstorms. Lara said this is first-of-its-kind regulation. Once the new regulations are fully implemented, which is expected by December 2024, insurers will be required to have 85% of new policies they write cover property in areas prone to wildfires. Regulators believe that will help Californians to move off the FAIR plan.\nâWeâre not going to get to affordability if we donât tackle the availability issue,â Lara said.\nMore available options for policies are expected to increase competition for better rates.\nâThis is yet another example of how climate change is directly threatening our communities and livelihoods. It is critical that Californiaâs insurance market works to protect homes and businesses in every corner of our state,â Newsom said in a statement.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Supporters of a controversial climate solution say it could be key. Critics believe it is the path to catastrophe\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nWhen US startup Make Sunsets released two weather balloons into the skies above Mexico’s Baja California peninsula last year, it kicked up a fierce debate about one of the world’s most controversial climate solutions.\nThe plan was for the balloons, filled with helium and a small amount of sulfur dioxide, to float high into the stratosphere. There they would burst, dispersing their load of sun-reflecting sulfur dioxide particles and cool the Earth, just a tiny bit.\nSome dismissed it as a stunt. It is not clear if any particles were actually released or even if the balloons made it to the stratosphere. But Make Sunsets’ experiment is significant for crossing a threshold when it comes to a hotly-debated climate solution: solar geoengineering.\nTo its supporters, solar geoengineering is a fix we cannot ignore as the world hurtles toward climate disaster. For critics, it is a technology so dangerous we shouldn’t even research it.\nWhat is solar geoengineering?\nAt its simplest, solar geoengineering, also known as solar radiation management, is an attempt to bring down the planet’s temperature by reflecting sunlight away or allowing more heat to escape into space.\nThere are three main techniques:\nMarine cloud brightening involves trying to make the low clouds over the ocean more reflective by spraying them with sea salt.\nCirrus cloud thinning targets wispy clouds higher up in the atmosphere, seeding them with aerosol particles in an attempt to thin them, so they trap less heat.\nThe most-researched method, however, is stratospheric aerosol injection. It involves spraying aerosols — such as sulfur dioxide particles — into the stratosphere, more than 12 miles above the Earth’s surface, to reflect sunlight back into space. It could be done with balloons or specialized airplanes able to fly at high altitude.\nThe idea takes its cue from volcanoes. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, the sulfur dioxide it expelled high into the atmosphere had the effect of temporarily cooling the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit).\nWhy is solar geoengineering such a hot topic?\nThe idea has been around since the 1960s, but it’s getting more attention because progress to tackle climate change is so far off-pace.\nThe world is on track to pass critical warming thresholds, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages increase dramatically.\nScientists have even gone as far as to propose blowing moon dust toward the Earth to act as a sun shield, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the planet.\n“I wish there was no geoengineering!” Luke Iseman, the founder of Make Sunsets told CNN in an email. But “there are no other realistic options to stay below 2 [degrees Celsius],” he said.\nWhile pretty much no one is claiming solar geoengineering could replace planet-warming pollution cuts and solve climate change, supporters argue it could have a big planetary cooling effect for a relatively small price tag. A 2018 Harvard study estimated it would cost around $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period.\nThe world needs to cut emissions, “no question,” David Keith, professor of applied physics and public policy, at Harvard University told CNN. But it doesn’t mean we can afford to ignore other climate solutions, he added.\n“I’m not saying we have to do solar geoengineering, but I think it’s worth considering all the tools,” he said.\nChris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told CNN there are good reasons to be skeptical of solar geoengineering. But, he said, if it “could provide a path for decreasing the impacts of climate change on millions of the world’s most vulnerable people (and on ecosystems), we have a responsibility to explore the opportunities, as well as the risks.”\nFor some of the most at-risk countries, including low-lying island nations, climate change already threatens their existence. A 2019 survey of more than 700 climate experts found those who expected severe climate damage in their own countries were more supportive of solar geoengineering.\nWhy is it so controversial?\nIn the eyes of its opponents, the technology could open the door to an almost infinite number of potential negative consequences.\n“Just because we’re desperate doesn’t suddenly make solar geoengineering a good idea, because the risks are so immense,” Lili Fuhr, from the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN.\nThere are fears fiddling with the planet’s thermostat could alter rainfall patterns and shift monsoons, with potentially devastating consequences for crops.\nEffects could vary across regions, with some areas reaping benefits while others are harmed, increasing the chance of conflict.\n“When things go wrong, it is usually the poor people that suffer the most,” said Chukwumerije Okereke, professor of global climate and environmental governance at Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria.\nPeople are already suggesting African countries as a testing ground for the technologies, Okereke said. “It is a distraction from the sort of policies and help that should be coming to Africa.”\nSolar geoengineering could also damage the ozone layer, which shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, and is currently on track to repair itself after the success of a ban on ozone-depleting chemicals.\nThen there are the difficulties of implementation.\nAs the aerosol particles do not tend to remain in the atmosphere for more than about a year, solar geoengineering would have to be continuously maintained. If halted, there is a risk of “termination shock,” unleashing all the pent-up warming “waiting in the wings, ready to slap the Earth in the face,” Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at Oxford University, told CNN.\nIt would also require unprecedented international cooperation, Frank Biermann, professor of global sustainability governance at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told CNN. “It would mean that countries have to collaborate forever,” he said, including those currently at war.\nOne of the biggest criticisms of solar geoengineering is it could be grasped by polluters as a way to continue polluting, and by governments as a distraction from policies to reduce planet-heating pollution.\nIn 2021, a group of nearly 400 scientists called for an “international non-use agreement,” a commitment to restrict the development of solar geoengineering “before it is too late.”\nGovernments should consider solar geoengineering in the same way they do chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear testing and Arctic mining, Biermann said.\nWhat’s the progress so far?\nThere has been a flurry of interest in the technology, especially in the US.\nIn 2019, Congress allocated $4 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for stratospheric research, some of which was for solar geoengineering. And last year, the Biden administration announced a five-year research plan to explore the concept.\nA 2021 report from the National Academy of Sciences called for the US to allocate up to $200 million to a research program to better understand solar geoengineering, including its feasibility, impacts on society and the environment, and public perceptions.\nResearch organizations are also providing funding. In February, the UK-based Degrees Initiative announced $900,000 for research in countries across Africa, Asia and South America to look at how the technology could affect the Global South.\nSo far, outdoor experiments have been difficult to get off the ground and have faced heavy resistance.\nAn attempt by Harvard University researchers to test a high-altitude balloon in Arctic Sweden in 2021 was abandoned after an outcry from local Indigenous Sami people. A letter on behalf of the Sami Council said solar geoengineering “entails risks of catastrophic consequences.”\nAnd following Make Sunset’s balloon release, the Mexican government announced in January it would ban solar geoengineering experiments.\nAs the world heats up and solar geoengineering shifts from sci-fi to mainstream, tussles between those who say there is an obligation to research it as a potential last-chance solution and those convinced it is the path to catastrophe are only likely to increase.\nCritics like Biermann, however, remain unwavering in their opposition.\n“It’s very risky. It cannot be governed. It’s unethical,” he said. “And it is one of the biggest dangers in the current climate policies.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "The origin of Elon Muskâs feud with Bill Gates, according to Muskâs new biography\nBy Paul Glader, CNN\n(CNN) — Bill Gates went to see Elon Musk in 2022, hoping to convince the fellow billionaire to give away more of his money â the way the Microsoft founder had.\nThe meeting went sideways, according to Walter Isaacsonâs new biography, âElon Musk,â which hits stores Tuesday. CNN obtained an early copy of the book, which reveals some of the rarified world of Americaâs billionaire class, including details of the unusual relationship between Musk and Gates. Musk is the current wealthiest man in the world and Gates had topped the list before he began steadily giving it away in his philanthropic efforts.\nâHey, Iâd love to come see you and talk about philanthropy and climate,â Gates texted Musk in 2022, Isaacson wrote. Musk had started a $5.7 billion charitable fund at the time â mostly for tax reasons, according to Isaacson â and Gates wanted to influence Muskâs approach to philanthropy\nMusk told Gates to call him directly because Musk didnât use schedulers and assistants, Isaacson wrote. Gates flew to Austin, Texas, on March 9, 2022, to visit the 10-million-square-foot Tesla Gigafactory.\nâJust landed,â Gates texted.\nâCool,â Musk replied.\nIsaacson spoke to both men and other sources to detail the conversation between the two men, noting that Gates challenged whether batteries could power large semi trucks and whether solar energy would be part of solving the climate problem. Gates said Musk was too âoverboard on Mars,â which Gates found âbizarre thinkingâ about saving humanity by moving some humans to Mars if there is a nuclear war on planet earth.\nAs the factory tour neared an end, Gates turned the conversation toward philanthropy. Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda, had founded one of the largest private foundations in the world, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and influenced other billionaires such as Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg to give most of their fortunes toward humanitarian causes during their lifetimes. The movement they started called âThe Giving Pledge has gained dozens of other ultrawealthy participants.\nMusk has been criticized for his lack of charitable giving over the past decade. He got into a public spat with the UN food program chief in 2021, challenging the assertion that donating $6 billion of his stock could end world hunger.\nStill, Musk gave 11.5 million shares of his Tesla stake to an undisclosed charity last year, shares worth about $1.9 billion at the time they were donated. The donation would make him the second-largest charitable donor in 2022, according to a ranking of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which was compiled before Muskâs donation. The Chronicleâs ranking lists Gates as No. 1 with $5.1 billion in donations, followed by Michael Bloomberg at $1.7 billion.\nâMost philanthropy was âbullsâ,â Musk told Gates, estimating only 20 cents of each dollar made a difference that way. Gates could âdo more good for climate change by investing in Tesla,â Musk said, according to Isaacson.\nMusk then questioned Gates on why he had placed a bet against Teslaâs stock, known as a âshort,â in hopes the share price would drop. Musk despised people who bet against his company, seeing them as mortal enemies. At that time, Gates had lost $1.5 billion betting against the stock. Gates said he apologized and said he shorted the stock because he thought he could make money doing so.\nMusk told Isaacson he felt Gates was hypocritical to fight against climate change while trying to make money on the failure of a sustainable energy car company.\nWhen Gates sent documentation about his philanthropic work and followed up with a text to Musk, Musk asked if he was still holding a short bet against Tesla. Gates admitted he was.\nMusk texted back: âSorryâ¦ I cannot take your philanthropy on climate seriously.â\nMusk then famously tweeted a photo of Gates in a golf shirt with a bulging belly that made him look pregnant and mocked his appearance.\nâAt this point, I am convinced he is categorically insane (and an aâhole to the core),â Musk texted Isaacson after the exchange with Gates. âI did actually want to like him (sigh).â\nGates was more gracious afterward. When people criticized Musk at a dinner in Washington, DC, Gates said, âthere is no one in our time who has done more to push bounds of science and innovation.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "China’s northernmost city just saw its coldest day ever\nHeather Chen, CNN\nTemperatures in China’s northernmost city plunged to minus 53°C (minus 63.4 degrees Fahrenheit) — its coldest ever recorded, meteorologists said.\nLocated in the northeastern Heilongjiang province and nestled near Russian Siberia, Mohe is widely known as “China’s North Pole” and is one of the few places in the country to have a subarctic climate.\nThe temperature at 7am on January 22, also the first day of the Lunar New Year, registered at minus 53°C, according to the Heilongjiang Meteorological Bureau. It beat its previous record of minus 52.3°C in 1969, officials said.\nChina’s meteorological authority has forecast big temperature drops in parts of the country and issued a blue cold wave on Monday.\nIn neighboring Russia, Yakutsk, which has the distinction of being the world’s coldest city, saw temperatures plunge to minus 62.7°C (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) — the coldest in more than two decades.\nWinters in Mohe are long and begin in early October, often lasting until May. Average temperatures during this period have been known to dip below freezing, experts said.\nIn 2018, rare “ice fog” — a weather phenomenon that occurs only in extreme cold climates when water droplets in air remain in liquid form — gripped residents, prompting local authorities to issue the city’s first-ever red warning for cold weather.\nNo alerts have been issued in Mohe yet but local meteorologists say the cold snap would continue into this week. Ice fog is also expected, they said.\nThe city’s constant cold attracts tourists all year round, who flock to its ice-themed attractions. In 2011, more than 10,000 tourists flocked to the city to observe the aurora borealis during the annual polar lights festival.\nA highway connecting the remote city to the capital Beijing opened in December 2019 to much fanfare.\nClimate change has worsened the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.\nJust months ago, China saw its worst heat wave since 1961 — which prompted massive power cuts and even reduced rivers to drought levels. The extreme heat stretched over 70 days and the impact was felt far and wide throughout large swathes of the country.\nIn the southwestern province of Sichuan, home to 80 million people, electricity cuts shut factories and plunged homes and offices into rolling blackouts — also killing thousands of poultry and fish at farms.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Why Fed officials arenât addressing the Israel-Hamas war the way they did with Ukraine\nBy Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — When war broke out in Ukraine last year, Federal Reserve officials were quick to speak about it.\nâLet me comment on what I think is on everyoneâs minds today: Russiaâs attack on Ukraine,â Fed Governor Chris Waller said on February 24, 2022, hours after Russia invaded Ukraine.\nâObviously, there are people in harmâs way and we shouldnât lose sight of them. It is far too early to judge how this conflict will affect the world, or the world economy, and what the implications will be for the US economy,â Waller said.\nNow, thereâs another war going on, between Israel and Hamas.\nYet in Wallerâs first public appearance after Hamas invaded Israel last weekend, he did not acknowledge the tragedies that have unfolded.\nIn his second appearance since the war broke out, he said he doesnât think there is a strong chance it will hurt the US economy unless thereâs a major spillover effect that chills business and consumer sentiment.\nFed Vice Chairs Michael Barr and Philip Jefferson, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan all made public remarks last week. None made mention of the war in Israel.\nEmma Jones, a spokesperson for the Fed, declined to comment on why many Fed officials, who in the past moved swiftly to acknowledge the war in Ukraine, werenât addressing the war in Israel.\nThat shouldnât be the case, James Dorn, a Fed policy expert and a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, told CNN. âThe Fed addresses climate change and diversity, youâd think they ought to address the seriousness of whatâs going on in the Middle East,â he said.\nThere are some Fed officials who are starting to talk about it, though â albeit only when asked questions.\nFed officials see little immediate threat to the US economy\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic was the first to speak about the war, at the American Bankers Associationâs annual conference last Tuesday.\nâMy heart goes out to everyone who has been adversely affected by that situation,â he said, adding that, âitâs really troublesome.â\nWith regard to how the conflict will impact both the US and the global economy, Bostic said âthis is just another new, unexpected thing that is going to cause everyone to have to rethink where our markets are going to be, where our partners are going to be.â\nDuring a moderated discussion at Minot State University in North Dakota last week, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari didnât address the conflict until the very end.\nâThe first mechanism by which geopolitical events â whether itâs Russia invading Ukraine, or the Hamas attack on Israel â affect the economyâ¦ is through commodity markets, through oil prices, first and foremost, but through other commodity markets as well,â he said.\nâWe saw huge price moves when Russia invaded Ukraine, so far much more muted moves around whatâs happening in Israel,â he added.\nKashkari labeled the conflict a âhuman tragedy.â\nBoston Fed President Susan Collins said that, âgiven the size of the US economy,â it is generally much more resilient to global shocks.\nâMany of the impacts of the horrific events and what weâre seeing at the moment are beyond the economic ones,â Collins said during an event hosted at Wellesley College last Wednesday. Nevertheless, the conflict is something the Fed will take into account in its models that help officials make policy decisions, she said.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said the US economy can still achieve a soft landing, a scenario where inflation retreats without pushing the economy into a recession.\nâNow thereâs a huge caveat that weâve been hit time after time with shocks â proverbial âblack swansâ that come out of left field that we donât expect,â he said on Friday at an event hosted by the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce.\nThe war in Ukraine was one of those, he noted, and now itâs âthis horrible situation weâre seeing in Israel and the Middle East more broadly.â\nItâs unclear if the Israel-Hamas war will âmore broadlyâ impact the global economy, Harker said.\nPotential economic reverberations of the war\nWhile it may be true that a war between Israel and Hamas alone may not amount to much for the US economy, thereâs a significant and growing risk it will escalate to a multinational war potentially involving Iran, Lebanon and Syria given the recent tensions among those nations.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon isnât treating that lightly.\nâNow may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,â he said on the bankâs third-quarter earnings call last week. The war, he said, âmay have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.â\nDorn of the Cato Institute said Fed officials âhave to think about the economic implications of this.â\nOne threat to the economy is if more countries â including the United States â impose stricter embargoes on Iranian oil. US sanctions on Iran are supposed to prevent Iranian oil from being sold in the United States, but traders have been able to find loopholes to get around it in the past.\nEven so, Iranâs influence on the global oil market is limited. According to Kpler data, the country exported only about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude in the third quarter, accounting for a maximum of 1.4% of global supply.\nBy comparison, Russia was the worldâs second-largest oil producer in 2021, according to Rystad Energy data. Thatâs why there was a much more immediate spike in gas prices across the globe after a slew of countries banned Russian oil imports after the invasion of Ukraine.\nThatâs probably why more Fed officials were quicker to acknowledge the war in Ukraine, Dorn said. But thereâs more to it than that, he said.\nâThis is a much more emotional thing for a lot of people,â he said, referring to the war taking place in Israel and Gaza, whereas Ukraine had a lot of bipartisan support initially. âI donât think the Fed wants to look like theyâre taking sides,â Dorn added â but said Fed officials could easily talk about it without looking partial.\nThereâs also a more substantial risk that a multinational war spills over into the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway off Iranâs southern border through which 37% of global seaborne oil exports travel each day.\nAny surge in oil prices that results from the war âwould likely lead to more demand destruction than in 2022 when the economy was fiscally stimulated,â said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.\nHigher gas prices, which are likely to cause consumers to cut back on spending in other areas, combined with the impact of all of the Fedâs rate hikes since March 2022, could cause the central bank to rethink further rate hikes entirely, Daco said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next\nBy Rachel Ramirez, CNN\nSomething to consider as you search for happy hours to celebrate National Margarita Day: The delicious concoction’s main ingredient is threatened by changing weather and new strain on the agave plant’s vital pollinator — the bat.\nAgave-based liquor like tequila and mezcal was the fastest growing spirits category in 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Analysts even say it might soon surpass vodka as the best-selling liquor in the country.\nBut scientists from around the world have made it clear that climate change-fueled water shortages will continue to put enormous pressure on food production. Wine and spirits, unfortunately, are not spared from that forecast. A 2019 study found that the climate crisis, coupled with overgrazing from cattle ranching and other human activities, may disrupt the distribution and cultivation of agave, the main ingredient of tequila.\nWhile agave is a drought-tolerant plant that can thrive in hot weather with little to no water, Omanjana Goswami, a food and environment scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the life cycle of agave is too fragile to endure the major weather whiplash the climate crisis is generating — from extreme drought to deadly storm deluges like the one California just experienced.\n“Agave is a desert plant, so of course, anything that is moving towards that desert-like weather is going to help this crop thrive,” Goswami told CNN. “But unfortunately, climate effects are not linear. It doesn’t mean that as temperatures warm that will remain consistent.”\n“With extreme weather in conjunction with unpredictability, it’s so hard to predict where this is going to go in the future,” she added.\nThe animals that pollinate agave\nAside from agave plants being sensitive to weather whiplash, there’s also a significant climate threat to pollinators. Bees, butterflies and bats pollinate roughly 30% of the food that ends up on our tables. Bats, like birds, are also considered a major seed disperser. But as temperatures warm, weather gets more extreme and seasons shift, those pollinators are at risk of major disruption.\nWarming temperatures have become a growing concern for the Mexican long-nosed bat â a key species for tequila.\n“You wouldn’t have tequila if you had no bats, because that’s the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,” Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN.\nThere are hundreds of species of agave, but only one â the Weber Azul agave plant â makes tequila. Other agave species were abandoned in Mexico and in the desert regions of the Southwest US. By law, to be considered authentic “tequila,” the spirit must come from the Tequila region in Mexico. Otherwise, agave liquors produced in places like California can only be labeled as an agave spirit.\nBecause of the high demand for agave spirits, it’s easy for farmers to fall into the practice of monoculture, where they reuse the same soil to grow a single crop, leading to a loss in genetic diversity, scientists told CNN. That includes places like California, where farmers do not rely on external pollinators like bats to grow their agave crops.\nBut some researchers like Ron Runnebaum, an assistant professor of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis, are looking to explore more of that genetic diversity to see what variants besides the blue agave can adapt and survive in a changing climate to avoid the loss in diversity.\n“For us, in the United States, and especially in California, there are just a lot of questions around how we would be able to grow this economically as a crop as a way of diversifying the portfolios of farmers, as they’re facing water shortages, as well as these other extreme events whether extended droughts or an abundance of water in a short period of time,” Runnebaum told CNN.\nEconomic opportunity\nAgave plants require little watering and can allow farmers to plant crops on land that would have otherwise been fallowed due to lack of water. And while it takes six to eight years for agave plants to mature, scientists say agave plants can also suck planet-warming carbon pollution out of the atmosphere.\nGiven these benefits — and as the West is mired in a multi-year drought — Craig Reynolds, an agave grower and founding director of the California Agave Council, said he sees agave spirits as an economic opportunity in a hotter and drier future.\nEight years ago, Reynolds began growing agave in Northern California as an experiment to see if it would be a viable crop in response to water scarcity.\n“We’ve gotten a lot of attention, because the biggest issue (for farmers) is the water,” he told CNN. The “severe cutbacks and groundwater allowances in state and federal water project deliveries, and the fallowing of hundreds of thousands of acres in California and projected long-term fallowing of farmland” is causing the growing interest, he said.\nWith the help of UC Davis, more resources are going into researching the viability of the low-water crop, especially under a rapidly changing climate. Reynolds said industries need to start adapting and thinking about ways to survive in a hotter and drier future.\n“There’s going to be some failures and setbacks here and there,” Reynolds said. “I’m not hoping for the climate to change. I’m just realistic in that we need to do everything we can to slow climate change, but we also have to simultaneously have adaptation strategies to the climate change that is happening — and agave is just part of the adaptation strategy.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Haley, Ramaswamy among those taking on ‘woke ideology’ in SC\nBy MEG KINNARD\nAssociated Press\nNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Republicans who are seeking to lead their party in the 2024 presidential race gathered in South Carolina this weekend with a goal at the forefront of their agenda: taking on “woke ideology.”\nOn Saturday in North Charleston, the group Palmetto Family, which lobbies for what it considers to be “biblical values,” hosted Vision ’24, described by organizers as “casting the conservative vision” for the next White House race. Several hundred attendees heard from presidential hopefuls, including Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who was Donald Trump’s U.N. ambassador, and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\nAs organizers expected, issues such as gas prices and national security got plenty of attention, with former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson saying that, to fight inflation, “we’ve got to bring the federal government under control.”\nBut, as anticipated, much of the focus was on the pushback by some across the U.S. against what they perceive as affronts to conservative ways of life by efforts characterized as “woke.” It’s playing out in state-level debates over classroom instruction, gender-affirming care for minors and collegiate diversity programs.\nThe catch-all label of “woke” is taking on a leading a role within the burgeoning GOP presidential contest, with candidate-in-waiting Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, emerging as a fierce opponent of policies designed to ensure equity when it comes to race, gender and public health.\nRamaswamy, who entered the race this month, wrote a book on the topic, particularly as it pertains to business: “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”\nThe debate has spilled over into the finance space, too.\nOn Thursday, 19 Republican governors, including DeSantis and South Dakota’s Kristi Noem, another possible 2024 contender, signed a letter opposing the Biden administration’s support of a federal labor rule allowing retirement plans to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. Critics say the efforts are the latest example of the world trying to get “woke,” allocating money based on political agendas, like a drive against climate change, rather than on earning the best returns for savers.\nDeSantis wasn’t on stage in South Carolina, but Ramaswamy and Haley were. Haley has adopted “strong and proud, not weak and woke” on yard signs, shirts and campaign stickers. At the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, she said that “wokeness is a virus more dangerous than any pandemic, hands down.” On Saturday, Haley called transgender students competing in sports “the women’s issue of our time,” adding: “If we don’t stop all this woke ideology that’s happening in our schools, we will lose them.”\nFor Ramaswamy, being “anti-woke” is central to his political brand. Leaving his biotech company following pressures for him “make a statement in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Ramaswamy called at CPAC for “an opportunity for the conservative movement to rise to the occasion and fill that void with a vision of American national identity that runs so deep that it dilutes this woke poison to irrelevance.” He later launched his own firm intended to pressure companies to quit ESG initiatives.\nOn Saturday, Ramaswamy called “woke” a “cultural cancer” in America, saying that, as president, he would advocate for starting over with agencies that “have become a cancerous rot.”\n“We will shut down the FBI and create something new from scratch to take its place,” he said, to big applause.\nIt’s a similar vein of messaging that South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, yet to announce his own 2024 bid but in attendance Saturday, has been making for years. In a 2021 op-ed, Scott wrote that, due to his status as the Senate’s sole Black Republican, he had long endured critique from “woke folk” because “my ideology does not match that which they prescribe based on my complexion.”\n“The radical left is trying to get people hooked on victimhood,” Scott said Saturday in North Charleston, adding that, according to Democrats, “if you’re white you must be an oppressor. If you’re Black or brown, you are the victim.”\nOthers took on the topic, too.\n“I think we should protect children … sometimes even from themselves,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told attendees, referencing transgender student athletes.\n“Woke is their favorite word, woke-ism is their favorite activity & they adhere to DEI and ESG like it’s a religion,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said of Washington Democrats. “I think that’s why 75% of this country think the country is on the wrong track.”\n“Republicans are not perfect,” said Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. “But the other side is crazy. … The American people do not deserve to be governed by deeply woke … people who hate George Washington, hate Thomas Jefferson … who think our kids should be able to change genders at recess.”\nFormer Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who told The Associated Press he would determine if he would seek the 2024 GOP presidential nomination by late spring or early summer — said “woke”-minded Washington politicians “are crushing the spirt of American educators and entrepreneurs and the American spirit.”\nFormer Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party last year, said her former party is being “driven by this motivation of cowardly wokeness” and has leaders who “advocate for the mutilation of children in the name of so called gender affirming care.”\nPreviewing the event on Friday, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson called the push by the “MAGA agenda” a “dog whistle” to some.\n“If they’re talking about a culture war and woke, then you’re not paying attention to the fact that your rights and your freedom to make your health care decisions as a woman are being taken away,” Robertson said, referencing pushes for more restrictive abortion laws in a number of states. “They want to talk about woke because they aren’t capable of talking about anything of substance.”\n___\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

        "story_text": "Brutality of prehistoric life revealed by Europe’s bog bodies\nBy Katie Hunt, CNN\nIn 1984, a peat cutter discovered human remains in a bog in Cheshire, England. They belonged to a man who died a brutal death some 2,100 years ago before being placed in the bog — examination of his well-preserved mummy revealed blows to the head, a possible stab wound and a broken neck. Twisted sinew found still wrapped around his neck may have also been a garotte.\nNow in the British Museum in London, the remains of the Lindow Man are perhaps the best known of Europe’s 2,000 or so “bog bodies.” These are mummies and skeletons that have been found mired in the peat and wetlands of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe.\nThe bodies — often exquisitely preserved by the bogs’ cool, acidic conditions and organic compounds— provide an exciting snap shot of the past. Archaeologists study their skin, bones, clothes, belongings and sometimes even their last meal. Now, researchers have undertaken the first comprehensive survey of bog bodies — a burial tradition they believe spanned 7,000 years — to build up a fuller picture of the phenomenon.\n“We should not focus on just a few spectacular finds. It is really important sometimes as archaeologists to zoom out,” said Roy van Beek, an assistant professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and coauthor of the study.\n“Sometimes, you have to be really careful that you’re not making conclusions or drawing conclusions too quickly, just based on a very limited number of sites.”\nVan Beek and his colleagues collated data on 1,000 bog bodies found at 266 different sites, uncovering intriguing findings published this week in the journal Antiquity.\nGruesome ends\nWhile bogs can be treacherous places in which it’s easy to get lost, meaning some bog bodies are likely those of people who died by accident, the team found that many deaths were deliberate — and brutal, with the corpses dumped or placed in bogs after death.\n“In many cases, it’s not a coincidence that these people ended up in these bogs. Too often, violence is something that comes into play,” van Beek said.\nThe team were able establish the cause of death for 57 individuals, and in 45 cases violence was involved. The highest number of violent deaths appeared during two timeframes: from 5200 BC to 2800 BC and 1000 BC to 1100 AD.\nBone arrowheads were found embedded in the skull and sternum of Porsmose Man, a bog body found in Denmark. Similarly, Tollund Man, also found in a Danish peat bog, was hanged. Some historians believe he may have been a human sacrifice.\n“People have always been inclined to interpret most of these as ritual sacrifices — that people were deliberately killed as offerings for higher powers,” van Beek explained.\nWhile ritual violence and human sacrifices did occur, van Beek said there were likely many other explanations as to how the bodies ended up in the bogs.\n“They could have been robbed and killed in some kind of conflict. Another category could have been individuals who crossed some kind of social boundary — maybe they were criminals who were executed or people who had committed suicide or adultery.”\nSkeletons vs mummies\nThe study divided the bog bodies into three categories: bog mummies, the most famous finds excavated with skin, soft tissue and hair intact; bog skeletons, complete bodies but with only bones preserved; and partial remains of either bog mummies or skeletons.\nBog mummies are typically found in raised bogs — discrete chunks of wet land several feet higher than the surrounding area, rather than sweeping blanket bogs that cover large areas. Organic components in plants like Sphagnum moss, found in naturally acidic peat bogs, can preserve human tissue. In more alkaline wetlands such as fens, only bone tends to preserve.\n“The survival of human tissue also depends on how quickly a body is immersed in water, the temperature and time of year, and the presence of insects and internal micro-organisms,” the study said.\nExaminations of the three types of bog body revealed that burying bodies in bogs was a deep-rooted tradition that spanned thousands of years. The phenomenon appears to have originated in southern Scandinavia around 7,000 years ago, and it gradually spread across Northern Europe.\nThe youngest finds, from Ireland and Scotland, show the tradition continued into the Medieval period and early modern times. The Iron Age and Roman era, from 1200 BC to around 500 AD, were generally perceived as marking the peak of the bog body phenomenon.\nWhile most of the sites featured only one corpse, it wasn’t unusual to find bog body hotspots where the remains of multiple people were discovered, sometimes accompanied by valuable objects. One exceptional site is Alken Enge near Skanderborg, Denmark, which includes more than 380 individuals killed in violent conflict and deposited in wetlands along with weapons almost 2,000 years ago.\n“These mires and bogs are generally known for their natural qualities … and high biodiversity. They are places where special plants, animals (live) and they are very important carbon stocks that protect against climate change,” said van Beek.\n“But if you look at this type of research, we could say they are extremely valuable cultural archives as well, which yield really high quality evidence about human behavior for millennia.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Biden administration to approve major Alaska oil drilling project Willow\nBy Ella Nilsen, CNN\nThe Biden administration is soon set to approve ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project, a major oil drilling project on Alaska’s North Slope, according to a congressional source familiar with the details. The decision will be announced next week, the source confirmed.\nThe expected approval is a victory for Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation and a coalition of Alaska Native tribes and groups who hailed the drilling venture as a much-needed new source of revenue and jobs for the remote region. It is a major blow to climate groups and Alaska Natives who oppose Willow, arguing the project will hurt the president’s ambitious climate goals and pose health and environmental risks.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back Friday, saying no final decision on the project had been made, and that the US Department of the Interior would make an “independent decision on the Willow Project.”\n“No final decisions have been made — anyone who says there has been a final decision is wrong,” Jean-Pierre said. “President Biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda of any US president in history and spurring an unprecedented expansion of clean energy.”\nAn Interior Department spokesperson declined to comment. Dennis Nuss, a spokesperson for ConocoPhillips, told CNN that no record of a decision about the Willow project had been shared with the company and was unable to comment.\nIt was not immediately clear if the administration had approved a version of the project with three drilling pads, or a smaller version with two drilling pads. Earlier this month, White House officials had floated the option of a smaller, two drill-pad project to try to assuage the concern of environmental groups. And in the final weeks and days leading up to the project’s approval, multiple finished versions of a record of decision had circulated among White House and Interior staff, the source said.\nWhite House senior adviser on climate and clean energy implementation John Podesta told CNN on Thursday the White House climate office has “stayed in touch” with the Interior Department on the project but insisted Interior would make the final decision.\nLast Friday, Alaska’s congressional delegation met with Biden and senior White House and Interior staff. During the meeting, Alaska lawmakers argued the oil drilling project represented a just transition away from fossil fuels toward clean energy and said it would benefit Alaska Native communities on the remote North Slope — where food and fuel are incredibly expensive.\n“We made our case,” Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, told CNN. “They were in listening mode, for the most part.”\nThe National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, the federally owned area where the project is planned, holds up to 600 million barrels of oil. By the administration’s own estimates, the Willow project would generate enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year — equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.\nAlaska Natives supportive of the project have said it would help bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the remote region, as well as help bring astronomical costs for fuel down.\nNagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, said at a recent news conference the project had “majority consensus” among Alaska Natives on the North Slope. “We utilize the jobs that projects like this provide,” Harcharek said. “[They] provide income for the families on the North Slope.”\nOther Alaska Natives living closer to the planned project, including city officials and tribal members in Nuiqsut, have said they are deeply worried about the health and environmental impacts of a major oil development so close to their village.\nEnvironmental advocates are expected to challenge the project in court. Environmental law group Earthjustice has been preparing a case against the project; their legal rationale includes saying the Biden administration’s authority to protect surface resources on Alaska’s public lands includes taking steps to reduce planet-warming carbon pollution — and arguing Willow’s carbon pollution would ultimately add to that.\n“If true, the Biden administration is betraying its core commitment to stop runaway climate change,” Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen said in a statement. “We hope the Biden administration will make the right decision to reject Willow, and if it makes the wrong decision, we are committed to challenging it.”\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "What we learned at Davos: The economy is a mess, but there’s still hope\nBy Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nFriday marks the end of the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, an elite gathering of some of the wealthiest people and world leaders.\nThe glitzy retreat into the Swiss Alps looks increasingly out of date as the biggest war in Europe since 1945 deepens splits in the world economy. But that doesn’t mean it’s not important.\nThe meetings between CEOs, politicians, and global figures at Davos can help set the tone for the year ahead. Here are some of the key talking points from this week.\nIt’s a mess: The big stories coming out of Davos this year are full of phrases like “fragmenting global economy,” “economic uncertainty” and “the year of inflation.”\nWhile many executives and economists are now striking a more optimistic tone, global leaders are still fretting about the economic outlook. That’s not surprising since they’re contending with worrisome uncertainties — Russia’s war in Ukraine is still raging, inflation and interest rates remain elevated, there are looming energy and food crises, supply chain kinks and the debt limit standoff in the United States, not to mention the threat of global recession.\nThe meeting began with a new report by the WEF that dubbed this decade the “turbulent 20s” and the “age of the polycrisis.” Business executives, politicians and academics, the report said, are bracing for a gloomy world battered by intersecting crises, as rising volatility and depleted resilience boost the odds of painful simultaneous shocks.\nGita Gopinath, the number two official at the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the IMF is worried globalization is in retreat. “We’re very concerned about geoeconomic fragmentation,” she said. The issue had come up a lot in meetings with member countries at the conference, she added.\nCEOs and political officials are also worried about the United States hitting its borrowing cap on Thursday, forcing the Treasury Department to start taking “extraordinary measures” to keep the government open.\nIf an agreement isn’t reached, markets could plunge (like they did the last time this happened in 2011) and the United States risks having its credit rating downgraded again. The situation is a “mess,” said Peter Orszag, CEO of financial advisory at Lazard.\nJP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC from Davos on Thursday that the reputation of the United States as creditworthy is “sacrosanct.” To even question it, he said, is the wrong thing to do. “That is just a part of the financial structure of the world. This is not something you should be playing games with at all.”\nBut it may not be that bad: Many leaders’ economic forecasts actually struck a semi-positive tone, even as they factored in strong headwinds.\nSo far, energy supplies have held up in Europe, and the US and China are engaging in diplomatic relations — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He met in Zurich on Wednesday.\nChina’s removal of strict coronavirus restrictions late last year is also expected to unleash a wave of spending that may offset economic weakness in the United States and Europe.\nClimate change was a hot topic: The rich and powerful do love to flock to Davos in their carbon-emitting private jets to discuss climate change. But this year, severe warnings were issued to global leaders.\nThe UN Secretary General accused fossil fuel producers and their financial backers of “racing to expand production, knowing full well that their business model is inconsistent with human survival.”\nSpeaking at Davos on Wednesday, António Guterres said the commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is “going up in smoke.”\n“We are flirting with climate disaster. Every week brings a new climate horror story,” he said.\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg also made her way to Switzerland and delivered a “cease and desist letter” to fossil fuel CEOs — signed by more than 800,000 people.\nThe AI revolution is here: Some CEOs at Davos admitted that they’re using the revolutionary new AI bot, ChatGPT, to do their work for them, reports my colleague Julia Horowitz.\nJeff Maggioncalda, the CEO of online learning provider Coursera, said that he uses the tool to bang out emails.\n“I use it as a writing assistant and as a thought partner,” Maggioncalda told CNN from Davos.\nChristian Lanng, CEO of digital supply chain platform Tradeshift, said he uses the ChatGPT to write emails and claims no one has noticed the difference. He even had it perform some accounting work, a service for which Tradeshift currently employs an expensive professional services firm.\n“I see these technologies acting as a copilot, helping people do more with less,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told an audience in Davos this week.\nBad news is bad news again on Wall Street\nThere’s a saying on Wall Street that bad news for the economy is actually good news for the stock market and vice versa, reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica.\nThat’s because investors often bet that dismal headlines will eventually prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to cut interest rates and provide more stimulus that can help boost corporate profits…and stock prices.\nBut the debt ceiling debate in Washington is changing all of that.\nWednesday’s big market sell-off and the continued slide Thursday might represent a turning point for market sentiment. Still, after a promising start to the year, stocks have seemingly taken a turn for the worse. Bad news actually might be bad news.\n“We’ve been snuggled up in expectations of a soft landing for the US economy,” said Kit Juckes, chief global foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale, in a report Thursday. “Take away the blanket and it feels chilly.”\nNetflix founder Reed Hastings stepping down as co-CEO\nNetflix announced Thursday that its founder Reed Hastings is stepping down as co-CEO at the company and will serve as executive chairman. Hastings will be replaced by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, reports my colleague Clare Duffy.\nUnder Hastings’ leadership, Netflix disrupted legacy movie rental companies like Blockbuster and helped shake up Hollywood by kicking off an arms race investing in original content.\nLast year, however, Netflix saw its stock and reputation take a hit after losing subscribers amid heightened competition from rival streaming services. In response, Netflix introduced a lower-priced, ad-supported tier for the first time in its history.\nThose changes may be paying off. In its earnings report on Thursday, the streamer said it added more than 7.6 million subscribers during the final three months of last year, well above the 4.5 million additions it had projected, for a total of more than 230 million paying subscribers worldwide.\n“Reed Hastings stepping down from his current role raises a lot of questions about Netflix’s future strategy,” Jamie Lumbley, analyst at investment firm Third Bridge, said in a statement. “While the subscriber growth numbers are encouraging, revenue growth is sluggish with the backdrop of a potential recession looming on everyone’s mind.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "India urges G-20 ministers to look beyond East-West crisis\nBy MATTHEW LEE\nAP Diplomatic Writer\nNEW DELHI (AP) — Top diplomats from the world’s major industrialized and developing nations on Thursday opened what are expected to be contentious talks dominated by Russia’s war in Ukraine and China’s moves to boost its global influence.\nHost India appealed for all members of the fractured Group of 20 to reach consensus on issues of deep concern to poorer countries even if the broader East-West split over Ukraine cannot be resolved.\nIn a video address to the assembled foreign ministers in New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged them not to allow current tensions to destroy agreements that might be reached on food and energy security, climate change and the debt crisis.\n“We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,” Modi told the group, which included U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, whose discussions would naturally be “affected by the geopolitical tensions of the day.”\n“We all have our positions and our perspectives on how these tensions should be resolved,” he said, adding that: “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can.”\nIn a nod to fears that the increasingly bitter rift between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other appears likely to widen further, Modi said that “multilateralism is in crisis today.”\nHe lamented that the two main goals of the post-World War II international order — preventing conflict and fostering cooperation — were elusive. “The experience of the last two years, financial crisis, pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed in both its mandates,” he said.\nIndian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar then addressed the group in person, telling them that they “must find common ground and provide direction.”\nWhile they were all in the same room, there was no sign that Blinken would sit down with either his Russian or Chinese counterparts. Ahead of the meeting, Blinken said he had no plans to meet with them individually but expected to see them in group settings.\nIn addition to attending the G-20 and seeing Modi and Jaishankar individually on Thursday, Blinken’s official schedule had him meeting only the foreign ministers of Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa.\nAs at most international events since last year, the split over the war in Ukraine and its impact on global energy and food security will overshadow the proceedings. But as the conflict has dragged on over the past 12 months, the divide has grown and now threatens to become a principal irritant in U.S.-China ties that were already on the rocks for other reasons.\nA Chinese peace proposal for Ukraine that has drawn praise from Russia but dismissals from the West has done nothing to improve matters as U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China in recent days of considering the provision of weapons to Russia for use in the war.\nBlinken on Wednesday warned China against transferring lethal military equipment to Russia, saying there would be significant consequences for such actions. And, Blinken said that the Chinese plan rang hollow given its focus on “sovereignty” compared to its own recent actions.\n“China can’t have it both ways,” Blinken told reporters in Tashkent, Uzbekistan before traveling to New Delhi. “It can’t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public, while in one way or another, it continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.”\nHe also said there is “zero evidence” that Putin is genuinely prepared for diplomacy to end the war. “To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction,” he said.\nIn the meantime, Moscow has been unrelenting in pushing its view that the West, led by the U.S., is trying to destroy Russia.\nAhead of the meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry slammed U.S. policies, saying that Lavrov and his delegation would use the G-20 to “focus on the attempts by the West to take revenge for the inevitable disappearance of the levers of dominance from its hands.”\nThe antagonism has left India in the unenviable position of trying to reconcile clearly irreconcilable differences.\nThe meeting is particularly crucial for India’s hopes to use its chairmanship of the group to leverage its position on the global stage and adopt a neutral stance on Ukraine in order to focus on issues of importance to developing nations like rising inflation, debt stress, health, climate change and food and energy security.\nBut just last week, India was forced to issue a chair’s summary at the conclusion of the G-20 finance ministers’ meeting after Russia and China objected to a joint communique that retained language on the war in Ukraine drawn directly from the declaration from last year’s G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.\nIndia hopes to avert a repeat of that, but prospects appear dim. U.S. officials said discussions were ongoing about language that could be used in a final statement but could not predict if they would succeed.\nSo far, though, India has refrained from directly criticizing Russia, its major Cold War-era ally, while increasing imports of Russian oil, even as it has increasingly faced pressure to take a firm stand on Moscow. India has also abstained from voting in U.N. resolutions that condemn the Ukraine invasion.",

        "story_text": "New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, an icon to many, to step down\nBy NICK PERRY\nAssociated Press\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who became a global icon of the left and exemplified a new style of leadership, said Thursday that she would leave office.\nJust 37 when she became leader, Ardern was praised around the world for her handling of the nation’s worst-ever mass shooting and the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. But she faced mounting political pressures at home and a level of vitriol from some that hadn’t been experienced by previous New Zealand leaders.\nStill, her announcement came as a shock throughout the nation of 5 million people.\nFighting back tears, Ardern told reporters in Napier that Feb. 7 would be her last day as prime minister after five and a half years in office.\n“I know what this job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It is that simple,” she said.\nLawmakers in her Labour Party will vote for a new leader on Sunday.\nArdern became an inspiration to women around the world after first winning the top job in 2017. She seemed to herald a new generation of leadership — she was on the verge of being a millennial, had spun some records as a part-time DJ, and wasn’t married like most politicians.\nIn 2018, Ardern became just the second elected world leader to give birth while holding office. Later that year, she brought her infant daughter to the floor of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\nShe notched up center-left victories while right-wing populism was on the rise globally, pushing through a bill targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, overseeing a ban on assault weapons, and largely keeping the coronavirus out of New Zealand for 18 months.\nHer approach to the pandemic earned the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, and she pushed back against wildly exaggerated claims from Trump about the spread of COVID-19 after he said there was a massive outbreak and “It’s over for New Zealand. Everything’s gone.”\n“Was angry the word?” Ardern said about Trump’s comments in an interview with The Associated Press at the time.\nIn March 2019, Ardern faced one of the darkest days in New Zealand’s history when a white supremacist gunman stormed two mosques in Christchurch and slaughtered 51 worshippers during Friday prayers. Ardern was widely praised for her empathy toward survivors and New Zealand’s wider Muslim community in the aftermath.\nAfter the mosque shootings, Ardern moved within weeks to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. A subsequent buyback scheme run by police saw more than 50,000 guns, including many AR-15-style rifles, destroyed.\nLess than nine months after the shooting, she faced another tragedy when 22 tourists and guides were killed when the White Island volcano erupted.\nArdern was lauded globally for her country’s initial handling of the pandemic after New Zealand managed to stop the virus at its borders for months. But she was forced to abandon that zero-tolerance strategy as more contagious variants spread and vaccines became widely available.\nShe faced growing anger at home from those who opposed coronavirus mandates and rules. A protest against vaccine mandates that began on Parliament’s grounds last year lasted for more than three weeks and ended with protesters hurling rocks at police and setting fires to tents and mattresses as they were forced to leave. This year, Ardern canceled an annual barbecue she hosts due to security fears.\nArdern last month announced that a wide-ranging Royal Commission of Inquiry would look into whether the government made the right decisions in battling COVID-19 and how it could better prepare for future pandemics. Its report is due next year.\nMany observers said sexism played a role in the anger directed at Ardern.\n“Her treatment, the pile on, in the last few months has been disgraceful and embarrassing,” wrote actor Sam Neill on Twitter. “All the bullies, the misogynists, the aggrieved. She deserved so much better. A great leader.”\nBut Ardern and her government also faced criticism that it had been big on ideas but lacking on execution. Supporters worried it hadn’t made promised gains on increasing housing supply and reducing child poverty, while opponents said it was not focusing enough on crime and the struggling economy.\nArdern described climate change as the great challenge for her generation. But her polices faced skepticism and opposition, including from farmers who protested plans to tax cow burps and other greenhouse gas emissions.\nArdern had been facing tough prospects at the ballot box. Her center-left Labour Party won reelection in 2020 with a landslide of historic proportions, but recent polls have put her party behind its conservative rivals.\nShe said the role required having a reserve to face the unexpected.\n“But I am not leaving because it was hard. Had that been the case I probably would have departed two months into the job,” Ardern said. “I am leaving because with such a privileged role comes responsibility. The responsibility to know when you are the right person to lead, and also, when you are not.”\nShe said her time in office had been challenging but fulfilling.\n“I am entering now my sixth year in office, and for each of those years, I have given my absolute all,” she said.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ardern “has shown the world how to lead with intellect and strength.”\n“She has demonstrated that empathy and insight are powerful leadership qualities,” Albanese tweeted. “Jacinda has been a fierce advocate for New Zealand, an inspiration to so many and a great friend to me.”\nIn tweets, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris called Ardern a “forward-looking, global leader who has inspired millions,” and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Ardern for her friendship and “empathic, compassionate, strong, and steady leadership” over the years.\nArdern charted an independent course for New Zealand. She tried to take a more diplomatic approach to China than neighboring Australia, which had ended up feuding with Beijing. In an interview with the AP last month, she said that building relationships with small Pacific nations shouldn’t become a game of one-upmanship with China.\nNew Zealand Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon said Ardern had been a strong ambassador for the country on the world stage. He said that for his party “nothing changes” and it remains intent on winning this year’s general elections to “deliver a government that can get things done for the New Zealand people.”\nArdern announced that vote will be held on Oct. 14 and that she will remain a lawmaker through April. Because she will leave Parliament within six months of an election, no special election for her seat is needed.\nDeputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson announced that he won’t contest the leadership of the Labour Party, throwing open for the competition for who will take over as prime minister from February until the election. Among the frontrunners is Education Minister Chris Hipkins.\nIf no candidate gets at least two-thirds support from the caucus when Labour lawmakers vote on Sunday, then the leadership contest will go to the wider party membership. Ardern has recommended the party chose her replacement by the time she steps down.\nArdern said she hadn’t had too much time to reflect on her tenure in the role, although she noted that it had been marked with crises.\n“It’s one thing to lead your country in peace times, it’s another to lead them through crisis. There’s a greater weight of responsibility, a greater vulnerability amongst the people, and so in many ways, I think that will be what sticks with me,” she said. “I had the privilege of being alongside New Zealand during crisis, and they placed their faith in me.”\nAya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the Christchurch mosque attacks, tweeted her “deepest gratitude” to Ardern, saying her compassion and leadership during that grim day “shone a light in our grief journey.”\n“I have a mixture of feelings, shocked, sad but really happy for her,” Al-Umari wrote.\nArdern said she didn’t have any immediate plans after leaving office, other than family commitments with her daughter, Neve, and her fiancé, Clarke Gayford, after an outbreak of the virus thwarted their earlier wedding plans.\n“And so to Neve, Mum is looking forward to being there when you start school this year,” Ardern said. “And to Clarke, let’s finally get married.”\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this report.\n___\nFind more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",

        "story_text": "EU and UK strike new deal over post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland\nBy Rob Picheta and Luke McGee, CNN\nBritain and the European Union have reached an agreement on new trade rules in Northern Ireland in an attempt to resolve a thorny issue that has fueled post-Brexit tensions in Europe and on the island of Ireland.\nThe deal could potentially resolve the issue of imports and border checks in Northern Ireland, one of the most challenging and controversial aspects of the United Kingdom’s split from the EU. Northern Ireland is part of the UK but shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Windsor, just outside London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that the new deal, called the “Windsor Framework,” will deliver “smooth flowing trade” within the UK, “protects Northern Ireland’s place” in the UK and “safeguards” the sovereignty of Northern Ireland.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the tense relations between the UK and EU since Brexit. She said that in order for the two parties to “make the most of our partnership” new solutions were needed. She pointed to the UK and EU’s cooperation on Ukraine and said that “we needed to listen to each others concerns very carefully.”\nThe purpose of the deal is to fix the issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, an addendum to the Brexit deal agreed by Boris Johnson and the EU in 2019. The protocol was created to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU, meaning goods don’t need to be checked between the Republic and the province. The Windsor Framework will replace the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe two leaders laid out three essential areas in which the new deal will improve the protocol.\nSunak said the deal will protect the flow of free trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by creating green and red lanes for goods flowing into Northern Ireland. Goods that might end up entering the Republic of Ireland will be placed in the red lane for checks before entering Northern Ireland.\nGoods destined to remain in Northern Ireland will flow freely, Sunak said, meaning that “if food is available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, it will be available in Northern Ireland.” New rules affecting different goods — like product labeling — will be phased in at different times to make the implementation of the framework as smooth as possible.\nThe prime minister said that through the deal the UK and the EU have managed to protect “Northern Ireland’s place in the union” by allowing the UK government to determine VAT rates applicable in Northern Ireland, as opposed to the current system where the rates are determined by the EU. He said this would allow recent policies, such as the reform to lower the price of pints in British pubs, to now apply in Northern Ireland.\nFinally, he also announced a new “Stormont brake” that would allow Northern Ireland’s devolved government to pull an “emergency brake” on any new EU laws from being imposed on the province.\n“This will establish a clear process through which the democratically elected assembly can pull an emergency brake for changes to EU goods, rules that would have significant and lasting effect on everyday lives,” Sunak said.\nHe added that if the brake is pulled by the Northern Irish government, the Westminster government will be given a veto over the law.\nThe Stormont brake is likely to be the most controversial part of the deal as it raises questions over the imposition of EU law on a sovereign country. While the brake makes use of an old mechanism that exists in the Belfast Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that brought peace to Northern Ireland, there is inevitably confusion about how the brake will be used.\nIf the Northern Ireland government pulls the brake but the British government doesn’t use its veto, there will be tension between Westminster and Northern Ireland. If one party in the Northern Irish government wants to use the brake but another doesn’t (Northern Ireland’s government must be made up of politicians from both the Unionist and Republican communities) the government in Westminster might have to effectively pick a side.\nUK government officials implied in briefings on Monday that there is a certain degree of flexibility in what will happen in these circumstances. It’s clear from the noises both in London and Brussels that the deal has been negotiated in a way that assumes good faith — something that seemed impossible just a few months ago.\nThe announcement of the deal will also raise questions about the future of British politics. Boris Johnson, the former Prime Minister, has spent recent weeks arguing that Sunak should not drop the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, legislation Johnson brought forward during his mandate that allowed the British government to effectively ignore parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBoth Sunak and von der Leyen have made clear that this bill is now dead — possibly taking with it the political career of Johnson.\nVon der Leyen arrived in the UK Monday for final talks with Sunak, ahead of a statement about the deal in the House of Commons. On Von der Leyen’s schedule was also tea with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace confirmed.\nPotential backlash\nNow that a deal is done, Sunak faces a potential political backlash from hardline Euroskeptics in his Conservative Party, though many prominent Brexiteers have given the deal their blessing.\nVon der Leyen’s meeting with the King has proved controversial. “The King is pleased to meet any world leader if they are visiting Britain and it is the Government’s advice that he should do so,” the Palace said when it announced the sit-down.\nAccording to a royal source, the meeting would be an opportunity for Charles to discuss topics including the war in Ukraine and climate change.\nBut it was criticized by some prominent unionist figures. “I cannot quite believe that No 10 would ask HM the King to become involved in the finalising of a deal as controversial as this one,” former Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster wrote in a tweet. “It’s crass and will go down very badly in NI.”\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, signed with Brussels by Boris Johnson, attempted to recognize the delicate situation that Brexit created in Northern Ireland.\nOrdinarily, the existence of a border between an EU member state and a non-EU nation like the UK would require infrastructure such as customs posts. But during the period of sectarian strife known as the Troubles, security posts along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland became a target for paramilitary groups fighting for a united Ireland.\nIn theory, the Northern Ireland Protocol was intended to do away with the need for border infrastructure. It was agreed that Northern Ireland would remain within the EU’s regulatory sphere, and that goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would be checked before they arrived — effectively imposing a sea border.\nThat enraged the pro-British unionist community in Northern Ireland, who argued they were being cut off from the rest of the UK and forced closer to the Republic. Disputes about the arrangements, in part, have been a barrier to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has been suspended since 2017. The sharing of power between unionists and republicans is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement — the peace deal that marked the end of the Troubles.\nThe wrangling has also affected trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the extent that the UK has not fully implemented the protocol.\nWill this new deal fix things in Northern Ireland?\nWithout question the biggest issue in Northern Ireland at the moment is that it doesn’t have a government. The Belfast Agreement requires that Northern Ireland’s government is comprised of representatives from the the Unionist and Republican communities.\nDisagreements over many things, including the protocol, caused the government to collapse, with the Democratic Unionist Party (the largest Unionist party) feeling cut off from the rest of the UK due to being in the EU’s regulatory sphere and subject to new EU law.\nWhile this deal does make things less complicated and addresses the issue of EU laws being imposed, there will still be less friction between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\nIt’s also worth noting that the Stormont Brake can only work if there is a government, which could through stick rather than carrot finally restore the government in Belfast.\nHas Brexit helped or harmed the UK to date?\nThat depends on who you ask. Since the UK left the EU’s regulatory spare, trade between the two has been hampered. That has impacted all manner of businesses — from delays meaning retailers are unable to import fresh food in time to exporters giving up doing business in Europe due to it being too expensive.\nThe Bank of England has said that Brexit has made inflation worse for the UK and has discouraged inward investment.\nBrexiteers, however, are quick to dismiss complaints about the economics of Brexit as being part of larger structural problems, like the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the Covid pandemic.\nIt’s worth noting that this deal only fixes the specific issues surrounding the unique status of Northern Ireland, but doesn’t change anything for the rest of the UK.\nSo who is happy with this deal?\nThe EU is very happy. Brussels largely wants to stop thinking about Brexit, which has slipped quite a long way down its priority list since 2020.\nSunak will be happy for now. Prominent Brexiteers have given their approval to the deal, which was likely to be his biggest problem at home. Things might unravel as lawmakers examine the deal in closer detail, but the potential of a Conservative rebellion was the biggest risk to Sunak’s premiership taking a critical hit.\nHow are relations with between the UK and EU now?\nEuropean officials are vaguely amused that the UK is still arguing about Brexit and privately point out that the UK hasn’t been able to implement its own deal — a sign that the balance of power lies firmly in Brussels. Still, the quickest way to get a European diplomat’s blood boiling is by asking a question about Brexit.\nThat said, this deal really has been negotiated in good faith. The flexibility the EU has shown and willingness to leave certain legal issues vague shows a dramatic improvement in trust.\nWill Joe Biden be happy?\nThe US president has said repeatedly that his priority is protecting the Belfast Agreement. This deal in theory means that the risk of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is off the cards for a while. However, that doesn’t mean tensions will evaporate, especially if the Unionist community feels hard done by.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "Countries agree historic oceans treaty to protect the high seas\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nNearly 200 countries have agreed to a legally-binding “high seas treaty” to protect marine life in international waters, which cover around half of the planet’s surface, but have long been essentially lawless.\nThe agreement was signed on Saturday evening after two weeks of negotiations at the United Nations headquarters in New York ended in a mammoth final session of more than 36 hours — but it has been two decades in the making.\nThe treaty provides legal tools to establish and manage marine protected areas — sanctuaries to protect the ocean’s biodiversity. It also covers environmental assessments to evaluate the potential damage of commercial activities, such as deep sea mining, before they start and a pledge by signatories to share ocean resources.\n“This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,” Laura Meller, Oceans Campaigner at Greenpeace Nordic, said in a statement.\nThe high seas are sometimes called the world’s last true wilderness. This huge stretch of water — everything that lies 200 nautical miles beyond countries’ territorial waters — makes up more than 60% of the world’s oceans by surface area.\nThese waters provide the habitat for a wealth of unique species and ecosystems, support global fisheries on which billions of people rely and are a crucial buffer against the climate crisis — the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the world’s excess heat over the last decades.\nYet they are also highly vulnerable. Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise and increasingly acidic waters threaten marine life.\nHuman activity on the ocean is adding pressure, including industrial fishing, shipping, the nascent deep sea mining industry and the race to harness the ocean’s “genetic resources” — material from marine plants and animals for use in industries such as pharmaceuticals.\n“Currently, there are no comprehensive regulations for the protections of marine life in this area,” Liz Karan, oceans project director at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told CNN.\nRules that do exist are piecemeal, fragmented and weakly enforced, meaning activities on the high seas are often unregulated and insufficiently monitored leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.\nOnly 1.2% of international waters are protected, and only 0.8% are identified as “highly protected.”\n“There are huge unmanaged gaps of habitat between the puzzle pieces. It is truly that bad out there,” Douglas McCauley, professor of ocean science at the University of California Santa Barbara, told CNN.\nThe new oceans treaty aims to fill those gaps by providing the legal force to create and manage marine protected areas in international waters. Experts say this will be vital for meeting global biodiversity pledges nations made at COP15, the UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal in December.\nA successful treaty “will help us achieve the goal of conserving or protecting at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030,” Monica Medina, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, told CNN by email.\nThe agreement of the oceans treaty marks a process that started around two decades ago.\nBack in 2004, the UN set up an ad hoc group to discuss ocean protection. It wasn’t until 2015, that the organization adopted a resolution to develop a binding oceans treaty and, after years of preparatory talks, negotiations began in earnest in 2018.\n“It has been a long arc from the first time the question was raised, to where we are now,” Karan said.\nMany had hoped that 2022 would be the breakthrough, but talks in August — the second round that year — ended in failure.\nThese latest negotiations were billed as a final chance for the world’s oceans.\nThere were points during the negotiations where some worried that agreement would never happen, as conflicts threatened to derail talks. “It’s been a bit of a roller coaster ride,” said Karan.\nMajor sticking points included nailing down the processes for creating marine protected areas and ensuring costs and benefits were shared equitably — especially as many developing countries may not have the technology or capacity to do their own scientific exploration of the high seas.\nBut after a grueling final session, the talks ended late Saturday night with an agreement.\n“We praise countries for seeking compromises, putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people,” Greenpeace’s Meller said.\nCountries now have to formally adopt and ratify the treaty. Then the work will start to implement the marine sanctuaries and to attempt to meet the target of protecting 30% of global oceans by 2030. “We have half a decade left, and we can’t be complacent,” Meller said.\n“If we want the high seas to be healthy for the next century we have to modernize this system — now. And this is our one, and potentially only, chance to do that. And time is urgent. Climate change is about to rain down hellfire on our ocean,” McCauley said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

        "story_text": "China’s population is shrinking. The impact will be felt around the world\nBy Jessie Yeung, CNN\nChina may be one step closer to losing its place as the world’s most populous country to India after its population shrank for the first time since the 1960s.\nThe country’s population fell in 2022 to 1.411 billion, down some 850,000 people from the previous year, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced during a Tuesday briefing on annual data.\nThe last time China’s population decreased was in 1961, during a famine that killed tens of millions of people across the country.\nThis time, a combination of factors are behind the drop: the far-reaching consequences of the one-child policy China introduced in the 1980s (but has since abandoned); changing attitudes toward marriage and family among Chinese youth; entrenched gender inequality and the challenges of raising children in China’s expensive cities.\nExperts warn that, if sustained, the trend could also pose a problem for the rest of the world, with China playing a key role in driving global growth as the second-largest economy.\nA falling population is likely to exacerbate China’s problems with an aging workforce and drag on growth, adding to its woes as it struggles to recover from the pandemic.\nWhy this is happening\nThe population decline is partially a result of China’s one-child policy, which for more than 35 years limited couples to only having one child. Women caught going against the policy were often subject to forced abortions, heavy fines, and eviction.\nAlarmed by the falling birth rate in recent years, the government scrapped the rule. In 2015, it allowed couples to have two children, and in 2021 raised this to three. But the policy change and other government efforts, such as offering financial incentives, have had little effect — for various reasons.\nHigh living and education costs and skyrocketing property prices are major factors. Many people — especially in cities — face stagnating wages, fewer job opportunities, and grueling work hours that make it both difficult and expensive to raise one child, let alone three.\nThese issues are exacerbated by entrenched gender roles that often place the bulk of housework and child care on women — who, more educated and financially independent than ever, are increasingly unwilling to bear this unequal burden. Women have also reported facing discrimination at work based on their marital or parental status, with employers often reluctant to pay maternity leave.\nSome cities and provinces have begun introducing measures such as paternity leave and expanded child care services. But many activists and women say it’s far from enough.\nAnd frustrations only grew during the pandemic, with a disenchanted younger generation whose livelihoods and wellbeing were derailed by China’s uncompromising zero-Covid policy.\nWhat this means for China\nA falling population is likely to add to the demographic problems China is already facing. The country’s population is already aging and its workforce shrinking, placing tremendous pressure on the younger generation.\nChina’s elderly now make up nearly a fifth of its population, officials said Tuesday. Some experts warn the country could be heading down a similar path to Japan, which entered three decades of economic stagnation in the early 1990s that coincided with its aging demographics.\n“The Chinese economy is entering a critical transition phase, no longer able to rely on an abundant, cost-competitive labor force to drive industrialization and growth,” said HSBC chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann.\n“As the supply of workers begins to shrink, productivity growth will need to pick up to sustain the economy’s heady pace of expansion.”\nChina’s economy is already in trouble, expanding by just 3% in 2022 — one of the worst performances in nearly half a century, thanks to months of Covid lockdowns and a historic downturn in the property market.\nThe shrinking workforce could make recovery even more challenging as China resumes outward travel and abandons many of the stringent restrictions it has upheld for the past few years.\nThere are social implications, too. China’s social security system is likely to come under strain as there will be fewer workers to fund things like pensions and health care — as demand for these services surges due to the graying population.\nThere will also be fewer people to look after the elderly, with many young people already working to support their parents and two sets of grandparents.\nWhat this means for the world\nGiven its role in driving the global economy, China’s challenges could have implications for the rest of the world.\nThe pandemic has illustrated how China’s domestic problems can affect the flow of trade and investment, with its lockdowns and border controls disrupting supply chains.\nNot only would a slowing Chinese economy drag on global growth, it could threaten China’s ambitions of overtaking the United States as the world’s largest economy.\n“China’s limited ability to react to this demographic shift will likely lead to slower growth outcomes in the next twenty to thirty years and impact its ability to compete on the world stage with the United States,” the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in an article on its website last August.\nChina also looks likely this year to lose its place as the world’s most populous nation to India, whose population and economy are both booming.\n“India is the biggest winner,” tweeted Yi Fuxian, who studies Chinese demographics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHowever, while Yi said India’s economy could one day surpass the US, it has some way to go yet. India is the world’s fifth-largest economy, having overtaking the United Kingdom last year, and some experts have voiced concern the country isn’t creating enough employment opportunities to keep up with its expanding workforce.\nStill, some researchers say there could be a silver lining to the news from China.\n“For both climate change and the environment, a smaller population is a benefit not a curse,” tweeted Mary Gallagher, director of the International Institute at the University of Michigan.\nPeter Kalmus, a climate scientist at NASA, argued that population decline shouldn’t be viewed “as a terrible thing,” pointing instead to “exponentially accelerating global heating and biodiversity loss.”\nWhat the government is doing\nChinese officials have ramped up efforts to encourage larger families, including through a multi-agency plan released last year to strengthen maternity leave and offer tax deductions and other perks to families.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping pledged in October to “improve the population development strategy” and ease economic pressure on families.\n“[We will] establish a policy system to boost birth rates, and bring down the costs of pregnancy and childbirth, child rearing, and schooling,” Xi said. “We will pursue a proactive national strategy in response to population aging, develop elderly care programs and services, and provide better services for elderly people who live alone.”\nSome places are even offering cash incentives to encourage more births. One village in southern Guangdong province announced in 2021 it would pay permanent residents with babies under 2 and a half years old up to $510 a month — which could add up to more than $15,000 in total per child. Other places have offered real estate subsidies for couples with multiple children.\nBut those efforts have yet to see results, with many experts and residents saying much more sweeping national reforms are needed. After Tuesday’s news broke, a hashtag went viral on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform: “To encourage childbirth, you must first solve the worries of young people.”\n“Our salaries are so low, while rent is so high and financial pressure so heavy. My future husband will work overtime until 3 a.m. every day until the end of the year,” one Weibo user wrote. “My survival and health are already problems, let alone having children.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "How old fishing nets could be part of the climate crisis solution\nBy Paul Glader, CNN\nVictoria, Seychelles (CNN) — Kyle de Bouter holds up a pair of Patagonia board shorts made of recycled fishing nets, smiling as workers nearby slice old nylon nets to stack into seven-foot square, one-ton bales.\nâThis is 100% what itâs all about,â he says, illustrating the future product possibilities.\nDe Bouterâs company, Brikole, is a startup âcircular businessâ that recycles discarded nets from the industrial tuna fishing industry. He noticed the nets piling up at the main port in this capital city and realized that recycling the discarded products could create a living for himself while also helping to clean up waste and create jobs. He dreamed of employing Seychellois to convert the nets into products such as bags, hammocks or board shorts.\nWhile the United Nations and others are finding some success at prodding large companies from developed countries toward sustainability goals, small and medium businesses in developing countries are hugely important and often overlooked. Researchers note small businesses make up 90% or more of commercial activity and employ a majority of workers worldwide but tend to be less engaged in sustainability. The United Nations notes that only 7.2% of used materials are cycled back into the global economy, declining from 9.1% in 2018.\nâWe wanted to create as much economic activity for Seychelles as possible,â even with a small, simple business, de Bouter told CNN.\nSeychelles, a small nation of roughly 100,000 people in the Indian Ocean, boasts 1.3 million square kilometers of marine territory surrounding its archipelago of 115 islands. Seychelles leaders and institutions are constantly looking for ways to counteract climate change and foster development on their islands. Since the area is prime for fishing, especially tuna fishing, many in Seychelles believe those industries are a good place to start.\nFinding a net positive\nRoughly 48 tuna ships from several countries â including Spain, France and South Korea â fish the waters of the Seychelles, using massive nets that pull in more than 400,000 metric tons of tuna and unload around 62,000 metric tons of tuna for canning at a factory in the Victoria port each year. Only the tourism sector contributes more to GDP than tuna. Government sources and researchers say the tuna industry provides more than 5% of GDP and around 68% of total exports.\nThe mile-long nylon nets, which periodically wear out, piled up at the shipyards and created litter.\nDe Bouter says government ministers, the fishing industry and the port authority understood the need to fix the problem and âwere instrumental in their vocal supportâ of his seemingly simple project when it hit operational roadblocks.\nA blue economy idea\nGiven its location, the Seychelles is embracing the idea of the âblue economy,â which the World Bank defines as âsustainable use of ocean resources to benefit economies, livelihoods and ocean ecosystem health.â The United Nations estimates the blue economy to be worth more than $1.5 trillion per year globally, employing more than 30 million and feeding more than 3 billion people a year.\nSeychelles has aÂ governmental âDepartment of Blue Economy,âÂ which has roadmaps to guide ocean use and development. Small island nations like Seychelles face unique vulnerabilities as they depend on the ocean for survival but also face impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns and acid damage to coral reefs.\nAdvocates of circular economy business models say the approach inspires small countries and industries to become more sustainable and more innovative. âIn a circular economy, products and materials are kept in circulation through processes like maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacture, recycling, and composting,â says the UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation. âThe circular economy tackles climate change and other global challenges, like biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution, by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources.â\nThe United Nations notes that more circular use of concrete, steel, plastics and aluminum could help reduce global greenhouse gas emission by 40% by 2050. It points to examples in Kosovo, Ghana and the Philippines to create circular economy models.\nSylvanna Antat, who directs theÂ Blue Economy Research Institute at the University of Seychelles, says although the island has added some support for entrepreneurs, it has room to grow. She and others want to see an incubator formed to offer space for young entrepreneurs.\nâSmall island states are on the frontline of the blue economy,â wrote Seychellesâ former president James Alix Michelâs wrote in a local paper, The Nation, in October. Michel had raised the alarm in past years that some of Seychellesâ uninhabited islands could disappear and is part of COP 28 this month in Dubai. He championed activity by âinventive young entrepreneursâ to improve society, mentioning recycled fishing nets as one example.\nSlowed by snags\nOriginally, de Bouter wanted to recycle the nets and produce nylon products within Seychelles. That would mean obtaining, moving, washing, drying and shredding the nets and putting them through an extruder to make nylon pellets that could be turned into fabric and other products. He soon realized the host of limitations he faced. Electricity for companies in Seychelles can be three times the cost in western countries. High rent costs and irregular supplies of nets creates additional hurdles.\nDe Bouter started partnering with tuna fishingÂ industry associations in Spain and France, meaning companies and ship captains from those countries operating in the Seychelles waters are encouraged to donate their discarded nets to Brikole.\nâThis is solving the problem of exhausted fishing nets,â said Julio MorÃ³n, a managing director of the Spanish tuna fishing organization called OPAGAC. In exchange for receiving the donated nets, Brikole agrees to keep Seychelles workers employed and to list fishing companies from France and Spain as sponsors.\nAs de Bouter gained nets to process, he didnât want to send the recycled nylon to China because of environmental, labor and transparency concerns. Eventually, he found a company called Bureo, based in California, that focuses on the problem of 18 billion pounds of plastic dumped into the ocean each year, aiming to remove what it sees as the most harmful form of plastic â fishing nets â from the oceans.\nSo after de Bouterâs team collects the nets, cuts them up and ships them to Bureo in Chile, the latter company turns the fishing nets into nylon pellets and then turns those into its âNetPlusâ material used in fabrics, sunglasses and other products from brands such as Patagonia, Yeti and Trek.\nWith Brikole recycling more than 500 tons of fishing nets last year, Seychelles could contribute a growing percentage â as much as 25% in the future â of Bureoâs total current nylon production according to Sigren. As a result, Bureo said it plans to set up a nylon processing center in Africa or Asia within the next two years so nets can be processed regionally rather than shipped across oceans.\nThe nylon industry rakes in $31 billion in revenues annually for companies such as DuPont, BASF, and DOMO Chemicals, according to Grandview Research, and is poised to grow at 5% per year. The work of Brikole and Bureo suggests that more of that revenue could be driven by recycled nylon rather than newly produced nylon.\nNext steps for Brikole\nWhen tuna companies alert him of nets for donation, de Bouter rents a crane and other equipment to move the nets to his workspace near the shipyards. His six workers untangle the nets and use sharpened kitchen knives to slice them into 2 by 3-meter panels.\nOn a recent sunny day in the concrete courtyard behind Brikoleâs warehouse office, Joshua Tiatousse was busy cutting nylon nets while standing barefoot on the concrete and listening to reggae music on his headphones.\nâA friend told meâ about the job said Tiatousse, 19.\nWhen de Bouter receives nylon fabric samples from Bureo made entirely from the nylon nets Brikole procured, he plans to send the fabrics to a local art and design school to have students come up with ideas for products, providing local creative input into the final products that partners produce.\nâIt will be a demonstration project to show the nation and world what is possible,â he said. âWe would like to say this is made from Seychelles.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "US ambassador calls on China to be ‘more honest’ about Covid origins\nBy Jennifer Hansler and Jeremy Herb, CNN\nUS Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Monday that China will have to “be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis” if the US and China are going to be able to work together.\nBurns added that the Chinese surveillance balloon and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.”\nBurns’ comments on Covid were made in reference to strengthening the World Health Organization, in response to a question about political polarization in the US and how it impacts America’s standing and ability to tackle geopolitical challenges.\nBurns was speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce event the day after news emerged that the Department of Energy assessed with “low confidence” that the deadly pandemic likely originated from a lab leak. While Burns was not speaking specifically about the latest assessment, the Department of Energy’s new finding underscores how US intelligence agencies remain divided on the origins of the pandemic — in part because Beijing has not been cooperative with efforts to investigate the matter.\nThe latest assessment, which was an update of the intelligence community’s views on the origins of the pandemic, further added to the divide among the 18 intelligence community agencies. In 2021, a declassified intelligence community report found four agencies in the intelligence community assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while the FBI assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident.\nA low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.\nUS diplomats have consistently raised the need for China to be transparent with the world about the origins of Covid-19 but China has not increased transparency, a senior administration official explained.\nWhile the new assessment has resurfaced questions about the origins of the pandemic, Burns said the Chinese surveillance balloon which the US shot down and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.” Burns said it was “a moment where we’ve got to manage these differences, hold China to account and build up our alliance system out here in the Indo-Pacific.”\nBurns noted that the US thought it “had a chance in 2023 for greater stability” coming out of the meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, noting that “a lot of that conversation was focused, frankly, on the differences between us, in our interest, both of us, in trying to manage those differences effectively so that we don’t end up in a conflict, God forbid, between our two countries.”\nThose prospects were stymied when the US detected the Chinese surveillance balloon in American airspace, Burns indicated, noting that, “we’re now in this surreal moment, where the Chinese who I think you know, lost the debate over the balloon, globally lost influence and credibility around the world because of what they have done.”\n“They’re now blaming this on us. It’s a little bit Orwellian. And it’s a little bit frustrating because I think everybody knows the truth here,” Burns said.\nBurns’ call for transparency on Covid-19 in the context of strengthening the WHO — a key global agency tasked with responding to pandemics — was mentioned as part of a catalog of things that Burns said “most Americans” would want Beijing and the US to work together on, including climate change and food security.\nThe State Department has repeatedly called for Beijing to be transparent about the origins of Covid.\n“It’s in everyone’s interest, it’s — including in the interest of the PRC, that they work with the international community, lend a degree of transparency to the international investigations into COVID origins so that neither they nor we nor any country around the world should have to pay this kind of steep cost again,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in November.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Extreme weather and falling demand are pushing wineries into the red\nBy Anna Cooban, Claudia Colliva, Maya Szaniecki and Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN\nLondon/Paris/New York (CNN) — Jordi Ustrell expects his vineyardâs tinder-dry plants to produce about half of their usual 15,000 bottles of wine this year.\nâThatâs a big loss,â the interim chief executive of Celler Devinssi, a small winery in the Spanish town of Gratallops, told CNN.\nUstrell is one of scores of European winemakers struggling to grow enough grapes as extreme and unseasonable weather becomes more commonplace. High input costs and declining consumption are adding to the woes of small, independent wineries.\nAccording to the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group, global wine production is set to fall to its lowest level since 1961 this year, hit by soaring temperatures and extraordinary flooding. Fueling that decline are expected drops of 12% and 14% in output in Italy and Spain,Â the worldâs biggest and third-biggest producers in 2022, respectively.\nClimate change is having a âtremendousâ impact on wine production, Giogio Delgrosso, head ï»¿of statistics at the OIV, told CNN.\nDelgrosso said that, in the past, extreme weather would strike every few years to interrupt long stretches of healthy, abundant harvests. âNow extreme climate events are always happening. Every year thereâs something.â\nThis year, heavy rainfall has helped mold spread through vineyards in central and southern Italy, while a severe drought and soaring temperatures have blighted vineyards in Spain.\nOther major wine producers, including Australia, South Africa and Chile, are expected to suffer drops of between 10% and 24% in output this year, according to OIV data, as floods, wildfires, droughts, and fungal disease have hammered vineyards.\nThe changing climate is helping others, however. Output in the United States, the worldâs fourth-largest producer, is forecast to grow 12% this year. Greg Jones, a climatologist and chief executive of Abacela, an Oregon-based winery, told CNN that, half a century ago, the state couldnât grow grapes. Now, he said, rising temperatures have made Oregon âone of the top producing regions in the country.â\nUstï»¿rell in Spain has come to live with the unpredictable weather.\nFor about two years now, it has hardly rained in Gratallops, which lies about 90 miles west of Barcelona. That has put serious stress on Ustrellâs vines. And snow, which seeps into the deepest layers of the soil, providing moisture for the vines during the dry summer months, hasnât fallen once in that time.\nItâs little surprise, then, that Ustrellâs harvest of Cabernet Sauvignon â a variety of red wine grapes traditionally grown in Franceâs Bordeaux region, where conditions are more humid â was the first to, as he put it, âcollapseâ this year.\nVineyards in Gratallops are so parched, he added, that 26 of its 28 wineries, including Celler Devinssi, have recently formed an association to lobby local authorities for funding to improve the water supply for irrigation, even if that means delivering huge vats of water into the town via truck.\nCeller Devinssi is not at risk of closure, but the 23-year-old firmâs bank account will almost certainly âbe in the redâ this year, according to Ustrell.\nFalling prices, rising costs\nAcross the border, French winemakers are grappling with the opposite problem: Too much wineï»¿.\nFrance is on track to pip Italy to become the worldâs biggest producer this year, according to OIV data, up from second place in 2022. The country maintained the same level of production as last year thanks to more favorable weather.\nBut the burgeoning supply of wine has exceeded waning demand in France and abroad, pushing down prices.\nThe mismatch prompted French and European Union authorities to announce a joint â¬200 million ($217 million) buyback scheme this summer, allowing French winemakers to sell their excess stock to distilleries for recycling into other alcoholic products like hand sanitizer.\nFalling prices have coincided with rising input costs.\nOver the past two years, a mix of soaring inflation and historically high energy prices has jacked up the cost of inputs like fertilizer, bottles and transportation fuel. Add to that higher interest rates, which have made borrowing to invest much costlier, and many winemakersâ already-narrow profit margins have all but disappeared.\nFrench winemakers struggling to sell their own produce have taken out their anger on imports from Spain. Hundreds of them descended on a major cross-border highway last month and stormed trucks transporting Spanish wine into France. The protestors smashed crates and emptied gallons of imported wine onto the road.\nFrÃ©dÃ©ric Rouanet, who organized the demonstration, explained to CNN that Spain makes many lower-priced wines and said the message to merchants was clear: âIf you want to get cheap wine from Spain, youâll have to buy our wine from us first.â\nOtherwise, said Rouanet, who runs an association of winemakers in Aude in France, the regionâs wineries simply âcanât get by.â\nâLost foreverâ\nMeanwhile, people around the world are drinking less wine than in previous years, opting for beer or spirï»¿its instead, or ditching alcohol altogether.\nGlobally, wine consumption has fallen about 6% between 2017 and 2022, OIV data shows, as consumers have changed their drinking habits and inflation has eroded their disposable income. That means nearly 1.9 billion fewer wine bottles were drunk last year than in 2017.\nEstimates for this year, cited by the European Commission in June, show even steeper declines across European countries, suggesting the trend may be accelerating.\nThe multiple pressures have forced some vineyards to close their doors.\nMichael Baynes, co-founder of Vineyards-Bordeaux Christieâs International Real Estate, an investment advisory specializing in vineyards, said the number of winemakers selling up,Â while still a tiny fraction of all Bordeaux producers,Â had âdramatically increasedâ this year.\nâItâs a bloodbath,â he told CNN. âWeâre seeing some very sad stories at the moment. A lot of multigeneration families are losing estates that theyâve nurtured for many years.â\nTheir problems started 20 years ago, Baynes said, when Bordeauxâs lower-priced wines were forced into competition with âNew Worldâ wines âÂ such as those from Chile, Argentina and Australia â that were rising in popularity.\nSurviving family-run wineries, and larger wineries selling into the lower end of the market, are in a precarious position, Baynes said. A bad harvest, a new export tariff, another interest rate hike can be all it takes for a generations-old winery to shut for good.\nAnd âjittery and nervousâ lenders arenât coming to the rescue of wineries they suspect would struggle to repay expensive loans, he added. âThey are turning off the tap of lending.â\nâThe families, the generations, the blood, sweat and toil that has gone into creating a lovely product may be lost forever.â\nA path forward\nClimate change was the reason John Mitra sold the Bordeaux vineyard he owned with his wife, Penelope, last year as it made predicting each yearâs harvest too difficult.\nâItâs just too risky,â he told CNN. âSome years you would get 3,000 bottles off a hectare. Other years, youâd end up with 50. Unless you have substantial financial backing behind you, you canât operate.â\nThe couple have since moved 340 miles east to establish The Burgundy Wine Company, a merchant specializing in wines produced by small, independent vineyards.\nThey chose the Burgundy region because it is very small, and so the wine produced there â less available, more coveted âÂ fetches higher prices than wine ï»¿from many other places.\nMore and more of Mitraâs suppliers and friends in the industry are deciding to sell their vineyards, or taking advantage of a French government subsidy to uproot their vines and replant the land with new crops, or to simply turn it over to woodland.\nSome have replaced their vines with olive trees and kiwi plants, he said, because they are more resistant to drought.\nMitra misses his previous occupation. For 12 months, through ârain or freezing cold,â he and his wife would tend to their vines. The two or three days spent harvesting the grapes each year made it all worthwhile, he said.\nStill, Mitra is happy to have chartered a new path in an industry he adores, and feels lucky to still be living among Franceâs fabled vineyards.\nâNow I just walk my dog in the vines, rather than own them.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "âUnstoppableâ energy transition means demand for oil, gas, and coal set to peak by 2030\nBy Anna Cooban, CNN\nLondon (CNN) — Global demand for oil, natural gas and coal â and the carbon pollution they generate â are expected to peak later this decade, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency.\nDriving the shift will be the âphenomenal riseâ of clean sources of energy, the Paris-based agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Tuesday.\nThe agency said it expects there to be nearly 10 times as many electric cars on the road globally by the end of the decade, and for renewables to account for almost half of the global energy mix, up from 30% today.\nSlowing growth in China will also depress demand for fossil fuels. The worldâs second biggest economy â and largest energy consumer â has reached an âinflection point,â the IEA said, with its total energy demand set to peak around the middle of the decade. China is also becoming a âclean energy powerhouse,â and accounted for more than half of electric vehicle sales worldwide last year.\nâThe transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and itâs unstoppable. Itâs not a question of âifâ, itâs just a matter of âhow soonâ â and the sooner the better for all of us,â IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.\nThe IEA report challenges calls by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) â a group of the worldâs major oil producing nations â for trillions of dollars of new investment into the sector between now and 2045 to prevent a spike in energy prices.\nAnd it stands in sharp contrast to moves in recent days by Americaâs biggest oil and gas companies â ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) â to double down on the future of US shale production by acquiring smaller rivals Pioneer (PXD) and Hess (HES) in deals valued at $60 billion and $53 billion respectively.\nâThe end of the growth era for fossil fuels does not mean an end to fossil fuel investment, but it undercuts the rationale for any increase in spending,â the agency said in its report.\nIn the near term, oil prices could be driven much higher by the war triggered by the brutal attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained nearly 7% since then.\nBirol said that the conflict could rock oil markets, 50 years after the world was plunged into an energy crisis by an Arab oil embargo triggered by the 1973 Yom Kippur war.\nâWe are today facing a major geopolitical crisis in the Middle East that could shock oil markets once again and deeply, because many oil producing countries are in that region,â Birol told reporters.\nâThis comes on top of the insecurity that we had in the natural gas marketsâ¦ after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,â he added.\nDespite the accelerating shift to renewables, and lasting changes to consumption patterns in countries such as China, the IEA â which monitors energy trends for the worldâs richest economies â warned that more needed to be done if the world is to stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nâBased on todayâs policy settings, global emissions would remain high enough to push up global average temperatures by around 2.4 degrees Celsius this century,â it said.\nScientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a threshold beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages will have an even greater impact on life as we know it. This yearâs summer in the Northern Hemisphere was the worldâs hottest on record, according to the European Unionâs Copernicus Climate Change Service.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Greenpeace activists scale Shell oil platform in the Atlantic Ocean as company announces record profits\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nActivists from the campaign group Greenpeace have boarded a ship in the Atlantic Ocean and scaled a Shell oil platform that is currently being transported to the North Sea.\n“Stop drilling. Start paying,” the activists’ banners say.\nThe protest comes as the oil giant on Thursday announced record annual profits of almost $40 billion for 2022, more than doubling what it posted in 2021. The company has benefited from very high oil and gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nGreenpeace called the action “a peaceful protest against the climate devastation around the world caused by Shell and the wider fossil fuel industry.”\nProtesters from the UK, US, Argentina and Turkey left the Canary Islands on a ship in the early hours of Tuesday morning, before transferring to three small boats. They used climbing equipment to board the ship and scale the nearly 400-foot (118-meter) platform.\nShell is moving the platform to the Penguins oil and gas field, northeast of the Shetland Islands in Scotland to help unlock new wells. The field is expected to produce 45,000 barrels of oil or gas equivalent a day.\nThe protesters estimate the ship will take about 10 days to reach the Shetland Islands and plan to remain on the platform for the whole journey.\n“Fossil fuel companies like Shell, that are responsible for this climate chaos we’re seeing around the globe, need to be held responsible,” Usnea Granger, one of the activists on the platform, told CNN.\nShe added: “Countries that did the least to cause this climate chaos that we’re in are impacted the most, and Shell is making billions and billions and billions of dollars of profit.”\nGranger, who is from the US, said experiences of climate-fueled extreme weather on the West Coast where she lived, including drought and wildfires, pushed her into climate activism.\n“These actions are causing real safety concerns, with a number of people boarding a moving vessel in rough conditions,” a Shell spokesperson said in a statement by email. “We respect the right of everyone to express their point of view. It’s essential they do that with their safety and that of others in mind.”\nPeople and businesses still need “a stable supply of oil and gas” as renewable power is built up, the spokesperson added.\nThe company said oil and gas output from the North Sea “is tailing off” but that it “is important to stop it tailing off too steeply, while the transition to low-carbon energy gathers pace.”\nYeb Saño, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a press statement that Shell “must take accountability for decades of profiting from climate injustice, and pay for the loss and damage they’ve caused.”\nLoss and damage refers to the concept that those who have contributed most to climate change should pay to help those who are experiencing the worst effects.\nGreenpeace activists in London also targeted Shell’s headquarters on Thursday, setting up a mock gas station price board displaying Shells profits with a question mark next to the amount it will pay towards climate loss and damage.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "âDivorce is not an optionâ for US and China, Newsom says after Xi meeting\nBy Michelle Toh and Lucas Lilieholm, CNN\nHong Kong (CNN) — âDivorce is not an optionâ when it comes to the worldâs two largest economies, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CNN on Wednesday following his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nIn an interview with CNNâs Christiane Amanpour, Newsom said his meeting with Xi in Beijing had revived hope that the United States and China were at a turning point in their relations.\nâWeâve got to turn down the heat. Weâve got to manage our strategic differences. Weâve got to reconcile our strategic red lines,â he said.\nNewsom â the first US governor to meet with Xi in six years â is in China for a week-long visit to promote action on climate change. His trip comes as tensions between the two remain high, leading to export controls from both sides on critical technological supplies, such as semiconductors and the equipment needed to produce them.\nâObviously, that was brought up and thereâs anxiety in that space,â Newsom said of the restrictions.\nBut Newsom said the fact that he was granted an audience by the countryâs top leader was âindicative of a thawing.â The governor has also scheduled a slate of meetings with numerous other high-level Chinese officials, which indicates âthat weâre entering, I hope, a new phase,â he added.\nIn recent months, a series of top US officials have traveled to China, repeatedly stressing that they are not seeking to decouple from China. Instead, they have pointed to a need to âderisk,â or reduce its dependence from the worldâs second biggest economy.\nNewsom said he had reinforced the same message in his meetings with Chinese leaders. âCompetitionâs good, itâs healthy,â he added. âBut derisking is very different than decoupling â¦ To me, itâs nothing more than diversification.â\nAccording to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Xi told Newsom on Wednesday that the achievements in the two countriesâ relations had not come easily and should therefore be cherished. Xi also expressed the hope that the governorâs visit to China would help stabilize the broader relationship.\nThe trip already appears to have generated some goodwill, particularly after Newsomâs visit to the southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen on Tuesday. The governor was seen cheerily taking a test ride in an autonomous SUV belonging to BYD, the top Chinese electric vehicle maker, during which he praised the companyâs technology and was quoted as saying âI want two,â according to Chinese state media.\nHis remarks were regarded âas a positive signal that at the level of the state governments, some people are willing to focus on practical cooperation, instead of the zero-sum geopolitical games,â Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times wrote Wednesday.\nNewsomâs administration has partnered with BYD in the past, with the automakerâs US arm sending California millions of N95 masks in the early days of the Covid crisis, helping the state reopen, according to a previous statement from Newsom.\nThe governor said that while he saw the United States and China as âinterdependent,â Chinaâs ongoing economic slowdown had likely put more pressure on Beijing recently.\nAs the country navigates a property crisis and its post-pandemic reopening to the world, officials are âdeeply mindful ofâ those challenges, âand I think thatâs also part of this desire to turn the page and to renew and reinvigorate our well-established relationship,â he added.\nChina is Californiaâs biggest trading partner, with nearly $166 billion in two-way trade in 2022, according to official state data.\nThe US state has outsize economic heft, recording $3.6 trillion in gross domestic product in 2022. If it were a country, California âwould be the fifth largest economy in the world,â Newsom told CNN.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "‘A time bomb’: India’s sinking holy town faces grim future\nBy KRUTIKA PATHI and SHONAL GANGULY\nAssociated Press\nJOSHIMATH, India (AP) — Inside a shrine overlooking snow-capped mountains, Hindu priests heaped spoonfuls of puffed rice and ghee into a crackling fire. They closed their eyes and chanted in Sanskrit, hoping their prayers would somehow turn back time and save their holy — and sinking — town.\nFor months, the roughly 20,000 residents in Joshimath, burrowed in the Himalayas and revered by Hindu and Sikh pilgrims, have watched the earth slowly swallow their community. They pleaded for help that never arrived, and in January their desperate plight made it into the international spotlight.\nBut by then, Joshimath was already a disaster zone. Multistoried hotels slumped to one side; cracked roads gaped open. More than 860 homes were uninhabitable, splayed by deep fissures that snaked through ceilings, floors and walls. And instead of saviors they got bulldozers that razed whole lopsided swaths of the town.\nThe holy town was built on piles of debris left behind by years of landslides and earthquakes. Scientists have warned for decades, including in a 1976 report, that Joshimath could not withstand the level of heavy construction that has recently been taking place.\n“Cracks are widening every day and people are in fear. We have been saying for years this is not just a disaster, but a disaster in the making… it’s a time bomb,” said Atul Sati, an activist with the Save Joshimath Committee.\nJoshimath’s future is at risk, experts and activists say, due in part to a push backed by the prime minister’s political party to grow religious tourism in Uttarakhand, the holy town’s home state. On top of climate change, extensive new construction to accommodate more tourists and accelerate hydropower projects in the region is exacerbating subsidence — the sinking of land.\nLocated 1,890 meters (6,200 feet) above sea level, Joshimath is said to have special spiritual powers and believed to be where Hindu guru Adi Shankaracharya found enlightenment in the 8th century before going on to establish four monasteries across India, including one in Joshimath.\nVisitors pass through the town on their way to the famous Sikh shrine, Hemkund Sahib, and the Hindu temple, Badrinath.\n“It must be protected,” said Brahmachari Mukundanand, a local priest who called Joshimath the “brain of North India” and explained that “Our body can still function if some limbs are cut off. But if anything happens to our brain, we can’t function. … Its survival is extremely important.”\nThe town’s loose topsoil and soft rocks can only support so much and that limit, according to environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, may have already been breached.\n“You can’t just construct anything anywhere just because it is allowed,” he said. “In the short term, you might think it’s development. But in the long term, it is actually devastation.”\nAt least 240 families have been forced to relocate without knowing if they would be able to return.\nPrabha Sati, who fled Joshimath in a panic last month when her home began to crack and tilt, came back to grab the television, idols of Hindu gods and some shoes before state officials demolished her home.\n“We built this house with so much difficulty. Now I will have to leave everything behind. Every small piece of it will be destroyed,” she said, blinking back tears.\nAuthorities, ignoring expert warnings, have continued to move forward with costly projects in the region, including a slew of hydropower stations and a lengthy highway. The latter is aimed at further boosting religious tourism, a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.\nIn 2021, Modi promised a prosperous decade ahead for Uttarakhand. It is dotted with several holy shrines and improving the state’s infrastructure has already led to a steady rise in pilgrims over the decades. Nearly 500,000 passed through Joshimath in 2019, state data shows.\n“In the next 10 years, the state will receive more tourists than it did in the last 100 years,” Modi said.\nA big Uttarakhand tourism draw is the Char Dham pilgrimage, one of the toughest in India.\nThe route takes people to four, high-altitude Hindu temples. Pilgrims traverse challenging terrain, dropping oxygen levels and harsh weather between Badrinath, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Yamunotri temples. In 2022, over 200 out of the 250,000 pilgrims died while making the journey. Authorities said the rise in visitors was straining existing infrastructure.\nAlready underway, the Char Dham infrastructure project, aims to make the journey more accessible via a 10-meter (32-foot) wide and 889-kilometer (552 miles) long all-weather highway as well as a 327-kilometer (203-mile) railway line that would crisscross through the mountains.\nIt is a controversial project with some experts saying it will exacerbate the fragile situation in the upper Himalayas where several towns are built atop landslide debris.\nVeteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra called the project a desecration when he resigned from a court-ordered committee studying its impact. To create such wide roads, engineers would need to smash boulders, cut trees and strip shrubbery, which he said will weaken slopes and make them “more susceptible to natural disasters.”\nUrban planning expert Kiran Shinde suggested a pedestrian corridor instead, noting these places were never meant for cars nor crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands.\n“The highway is the most disastrous thing to happen to the Char Dham,” said Shinde, a professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who has written on religious tourism. “Let people walk.”\nCracks continue to form. Located near a rail line construction site, Sangeeta Krishali’s home in Lachmoli, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Joshimath, has them. She fears for her safety: “It happened there, it can happen here, too.”\nIn Joshimath’s foothills, construction was paused on a road for the Char Dham project that would ferry tourists faster to the Badrinath temple after cracks emerged in people’s homes.\nLocals feared it was too late. A long, jagged crack running across one of the front walls in the famed Adi Shankaracharya monastery had deepened worryingly in recent weeks, said Vishnu Priyanand, one of the priests.\n“Let places of worship remain as places of worship. Don’t make them tourist spots,” he pleaded.\nIt’s not just the highways. For the past 17 years, Atul Sati, the Save Joshimath Committee member, has been convinced that a hydropower station located near his town could one day ruin it. He isn’t alone. In late January, hundreds of residents protested against the National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project. Posters reading ‘Go back NTPC’ are plastered across the town’s main market.\n“Our town is on the verge of destruction because of this project,” Sati said.\nLocals say construction blasts for a 12-kilometer (7-mile) tunnel for the station are causing their homes to crumble. Work has been suspended but NTPC officials deny any link to Joshimath’s subsidence. An expert committee is still investigating the cause, but state officials earlier blamed faulty drainage systems.\nThe state government announced interim relief packages, including compensation worth 150,000 rupees ($1,813) to each affected family, said Himanshu Khurana, the officer in charge of Chamoli district where Joshimath is located. Various government agencies were conducting surveys to determine what caused the damage, he added.\nThe crisis in Joshimath has reignited questions over whether India’s quest for more hydropower in the mountains to cut its reliance on coal can be achieved sustainably. Uttarakhand, home to more than 30 rivers and surrounded by melting glaciers, has around 100 hydropower projects in varying stages.\nIn 2021, 200 people died after the Tapovan plant near Joshimath was submerged by severe floods caused in part by fast shrinking glaciers, and over 6,000 were killed in the state after a devastating cloudburst in 2013.\nThe heavy construction required for hydropower, like blasting boulders, diverting river flows and cutting through forests, in a region already vulnerable to climate change, could do irreparable damage, experts warn.\nIt could also displace entire villages, as residents of a hamlet near Joshimath found out.\nHaat, a village along the Alaknanda River, was once a sacred hamlet that traced its origins to the guru Adi Shankaracharya, who is said to have established another temple here in the 8th Century.\nToday, it is a dumping site for waste and a storage pit for construction materials after the village was acquired in 2009 by an energy enterprise to build a hydropower project.\nThe Laxmi Narayan temple, encircled by grey stacks of cement, is the only part of the village still standing. All of its residents left over the years as authorities began razing down their homes, said Rajendra Hatwal, once the village chief who now lives in another town nearby.\nThe project, he fumed, had killed Haat.\n“What sort of development requires destroying these priceless places? We don’t want any part of it.”\nA court last year directed authorities to stop dumping waste near the historic temple, which was once the last rest stop for devotees on their pilgrimage to Badrinath.\nHatwal and a few others still check in on the temple often. A caretaker, who refused to leave, lives in a makeshift room next to it. He sweeps the grounds, cleans the idols and prepares tea for the odd guest who comes through.\nThey feared its days, like their homes, were also numbered.\n“We are fighting to protect the temple. We want to preserve our ancient culture to pass on to a new generation,” said Hatwal. “They have not only destroyed a village – they have finished a 1,200 year old culture.”\n___\nAP photojournalist Rajesh Kumar Singh contributed to this report.\n——\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "story_text": "Lightning in the ‘cataclysmic’ Tonga volcano eruption shattered ‘all records’\nBy Rachel Ramirez, CNN\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January 2022, it sent shockwaves around the world. Not only did it trigger widespread tsunami waves, but it also belched an enormous amount of climate-warming water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere.\nNow researchers in a new report have unveiled something else: the eruption set off more than 25,500 lightning events in just five minutes. Over the course of just six hours, the volcano triggered nearly 400,000 lightning events. Half of all the lightning in the world was concentrated around this volcano at the eruption’s peak.\nThe “cataclysmic eruption” shattered “all records,” according to the report from Vaisala, an environmental monitoring company that tracks lightning around the world.\n“It’s the most extreme concentration of lightning that we’ve ever detected,” Chris Vagasky, meteorologist and lightning expert at Vaisala, told CNN. “We’ve been detecting lightning for 40 years now, and this is really an extreme event.”\nThe annual report by Vaisala found that 2022 was a year of extremes for lightning. Lightning increased in the US in 2022, with more than 198 million lightning strokes — 4 million more than what was observed in 2021, and 28 million more than 2020.\n“We are continuing an upward trend in lightning,” Vagasky said.\nThe World-Wide Lightning Location Network, another lightning monitoring network led by the University of Washington, which is not involved with the report, said Vaisala’s findings about global lightning as well as the Hunga volcano are consistent with their own observations.\n“We can do this because the stronger eruptions generate lightning, and lightning sends detectable radio signals around the world,” Robert Holzworth, the director of the network, told CNN. “The Hunga eruption was absolutely impressive in its lightning activity.”\nResearchers have used lightning as a key indicator of the climate crisis, since the phenomenon typically signals warming temperatures. Lightning occurs in energetic storms associated with an unstable atmosphere, requiring relatively warm and moist air, which is why they primarily occur in tropical latitudes and elsewhere during the summer months.\nBut in 2022, Vaisala’s National Lightning Detection Network found more than 1,100 lightning strokes in Buffalo, New York, during a devastating lake-effect snowstorm that dumped more than 30 inches of snow in the city, but piled historic totals in excess of 6 feet in the surrounding suburbs along Lake Erie. Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air blows over warm lake water, in this case from the Great Lakes. The large difference in temperature can cause extreme instability in the atmosphere and lead to thunderstorm-like lightning even in a snow storm.\nThe report noted that many of these lightning events happened near wind turbines south of Buffalo, which Vagasky said was significant. He explained that the ice crystal-filled clouds were lower to the ground than usual, scraping just above the blades of the turbines.\n“That can cause what is known as self-initiated upward lightning,” Vagasky said. “So the lightning occurs because you have charged at the tip of this wind turbine blade that is really close to the base of the cloud, and it’s really easy to get a connection of the electric charge.”\nThis is an area of ongoing research, he said, as the country turns to more clean energy alternatives.\n“We’re seeing bigger and bigger wind turbines, and certainly as we’re putting in more and more wind energy and renewable energy, lightning is going to play a role in that,” he said.\nThe report comes after an unusual year in 2021, when they found lightning strokes increased significantly in the typically frozen Arctic region, which scientists say is a clear sign of how the climate crisis is altering global weather.\n“Lightning in polar regions wasn’t mentioned [in this year’s Vaisala report], but our global lightning network shows a trend for much more lightning in the northern polar regions,” Michael McCarthy, research associate professor and associate director of the World Wide Lightning Location Network, told CNN. “That trend closely tracks the observed average temperature changes over the northern hemisphere.\n“This close tracking suggests, but does not prove, a climate change effect,” McCarthy added.\nVagasky said lightning in colder areas will only amplify as the planet warms, noting that meteorologists and climatologists have been collecting more data to not only make the climate connections clear but also keep people safe.\n“That’s why they’ve named lightning as an essential climate variable,” he said, “because it’s important to know where it’s occurring, how much is occurring, and so you can see how thunderstorms are trending as a result of changing climates.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Flowers and trees blooming up to 3 weeks earlier than normal in the Eastern US\nBy Jennifer Gray, CNN meteorologist\nThis year might be another strike in the “loss column” for Punxsutawney Phil, which isn’t much of a surprise, since he’s wrong about 60% of the time. He forecast six more weeks of winter, yet it seems spring is already in full bloom across parts of the country where blooms should still be nearly a month away.\nParts of the South and Southeast are seeing their earliest spring on record this year, with leaves already budding on trees as much as three weeks early. Other parts of the South and Southeast are seeing their earliest spring in 40 years. Contrast that with southern Arizona, where they are seeing their latest start to spring in 40 years.\nThe National Phenology Network, which keeps track of the arrival of spring, maps the locations where it believes spring has already arrived. It does this by tracking the bloom of two plant species typically among the first to leaf out each year and are also “common across much of the country.”\nMuch of the “early spring” has to do with the warm start to 2023. Much of the South and Southeast are off to their top-10 warmest years on record, and several cities are seeing their top-five warmest: Houston, Jackson, Nashville and Atlanta.\nIt is even more dramatic in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Philadelphia and New York City are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, so the early bloom will most likely expand into the Northeast in the weeks ahead.\n“Plants are really sensitive to temperature, humidity and rainfall. They’re sensitive to photo periods; so the sun and things like that. They’re responding to these kinds of triggers in the environment, these cues that the climate is giving them, and they respond to that,” Megan O’Connell, a research associate with the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, explained.\nO’Connell said spring is coming early more frequently — and climbing to warmer temperatures — because of climate change, which is a significant shift for plants and animals. The timing of when plants bloom is critical for the pollinators who depend on them. If the blooms appear early, the blooms could already be gone by the time pollinators appear, creating what scientists call “ecological mismatch.”\n“While things are getting warmer, the weather is also getting more erratic. And so, plants and animals are responding to these kinds of chaotic weather patterns all very differently,” O’Connell explained. “It’s not that we’re going to see everything just move forward together. It seems like species are all responding differently, which is the reason we’re seeing a lot of these kinds of mismatching trends.”\nOne example is the monarch butterfly. Scientists have seen the milkweed they depend on to lay their eggs bloom earlier and earlier, but the butterflies are still showing up on time to fields where milkweed has already finished blooming and is gone. The mismatch might seem small but could have huge implications affecting all of us.\n“One out of every three bites of food that we eat” is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, communications director and wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN. Around 30% of the food on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats.\n“Think about the thousands of species of plants and pollinators out there. It could have some really catastrophic effects on ecosystems,” O’Connell said.\nBut O’Connell pointed out we can help pollinators tremendously by planting as many native species as possible in our own yards.\n“You can create little pollinator resorts for them throughout the year. Look up different species of flowers that flower at different times in the season, and then plant flowers so that you can provide food to them all season,” O’Connell advised.\nClick here to see which plants are native to your area.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Antarctic sea ice hit record lows again. Scientists wonder if it’s ‘the beginning of the end’\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nAntarctic sea ice has reached record low levels for the second time in two years, with some scientists alarmed that dramatic drops are a signal the climate crisis may now be more clearly influencing this vast, complex and isolated region.\nThe sea ice that fringes Antarctica dropped to just 737,000 square miles (1.91 million square kilometers) on February 13, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC, below the previous record of 741,000 square miles (1.92 million square kilometers) set on February 25 last year.\nSea ice could still shrink further; the lowest level of the southern summer may not be reached for more than a week.\nThe last two years mark the only time that sea ice levels have dipped below 2 million square kilometers since satellites began monitoring it in 1978.\nIt’s “not just ‘barely a record low,'” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CNN. “It’s on a very steep downward trend.”\nUnlike the Arctic, where the rate of sea ice loss has followed a fairly consistent downward trajectory as climate change accelerates, Antarctic sea ice extent has swung up and down, making it harder to figure out how the continent and its surrounding ocean are responding to global heating.\nThe two polar regions are very different. While the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents, Antarctica is a continent surrounded by the ocean — this means its sea ice can grow outward, unconstrained by land. Antarctic ice tends to be thinner than Arctic ice, with greater highs in the winter and steeper declines in the summer.\nClimate models projected declines in Antarctic sea ice that were similar to the Arctic, but until recently the region was behaving completely differently than those models predicted.\nIt hit a record high for winter sea ice extent in 2014 when it reached 7.76 million square miles, which seemed to support the idea that the Antarctic may be relatively insulated from global warming.\nBut in 2016, something changed. Scientists began observing a steep downward trend.\nAt first, some put it down to the usual variability of this vastly complex continent, with its diverse, intertwined climate systems. But after two low sea ice records in a row, scientists are becoming concerned.\n“The question is, has climate change reached Antarctica? Is this the beginning of the end? Will the sea ice disappear for good in the coming years in the summer?” Christian Haas, head of the Sea Ice Physics Research Section at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, told CNN.\nSeveral factors may feed into why sea ice is so low, including winds, ocean currents and ocean heat.\nAir temperatures have been higher than usual in parts of the Antarctic, around 1.5 degrees Celsius above the long term average.\nAnother important consideration is the belt of westerly winds which circle Antarctica, known as the Southern Annular Mode. These winds, which can increase sea ice melt, have been stronger than usual, according to the NSIDC, and added to weather conditions that pump warm air to the region.\nThe strength of the winds has been linked, in part, to the increase of planet-heating pollution as well as the hole in the ozone layer above the continent.\nThere are also suggestions that sea ice may be melting because of warmth trapped just below the surface of the ocean, Scambos said.\n“Basically, you’re getting heat stirred into the upper layer [of water] around the Antarctic,” he said. If that theory holds up, and is linked to the general warming of the oceans, “then that has big implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet.”\nThe disappearance of sea ice can have cascading effects in Antarctica and beyond.\nWhile it doesn’t directly affect sea levels, because it is already floating in the ocean, the loss of the fringe of sea ice around the Antarctic leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up.\nAn altered Antarctic landscape could have significant impacts on its wildlife, from the microorganisms and algae that prop up the food chain — food for krill which, in turn, feed many of the region’s whales — to the penguins and seals that rely on sea ice for feeding and resting.\nParts of Antarctica have been seeing alarming changes for a while.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of icy mountains which sticks off the west side of the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America, is one of the fastest warming places in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCarlos Moffat, an oceanographer at the University of Delaware, who has just returned from a research trip to the Antarctic Peninsula, told CNN that the low sea ice and very warm ocean temperatures they found “are dramatically different from what we have observed in the last few decades.”\nMoffat, who visits the region every summer as part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research, said: “This year’s conditions are against a backdrop of long-term change in this region of Antarctica.”\nLast year, scientists said West Antarctica’s vast Thwaites Glacier — also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” — was “hanging on by its fingernails” as the planet warms, with rapid retreat possible over the next few years. Scientists have estimated global sea level rise could increase by around 10 feet if Thwaites collapsed completely, devastating coastal communities around the world.\nIt’s too early to say whether the record sea ice decline is the new normal or whether it will bounce back, and Antarctica is known for its significant swings. The NSIDC points out that: “While 2022 and 2023 have had record low minimum extent, four out of the five highest minimums have occurred since 2008.”\n“It’s going to take a while to unpack,” Scambos said. “We’re still reacting to a relatively sudden change. Certainly the last few years have been a dramatic exclamation point on a trend that was just developing after 2016.”\nScientists will need at least another five years of data and observations, he estimated, but added: “It does feel like something has changed in the Antarctic and that things are fairly dramatic.”\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the name of Christian Haas. Furthermore, the last two years are only times in the satellite era that sea ice extent has fallen below 2 million square kilometers.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "This small airplane could hold the key to zero-carbon flying\nJulia Buckley, CNN\nAs the climate crisis intensifies, the pressure on the aviation industry to cut emissions increases. And now, the industry has taken a step forward, with a successful test flight of a hydrogen-electric engine, which produces no carbon emissions.\nZeroAvia’s 19-seater Dornier 228 twin-engine aircraft completed a roughly 10-minute test flight on Thursday in the UK. While 19 seats is, of course, tiny compared to regular passenger aircraft, it is the largest aircraft to have made a successful flight powered by hydrogen-electric.\nUsing liquid hydrogen to feed fuel cells, the technology eliminates carbon emissions during the flight.\nThis is part of a race to decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, although its overall contribution to climate is estimated to be higher, due to the other gases, water vapor and contrails it emits.\nHydrogen has been identified as a promising fuel solution for planes because it produces no greenhouse gases when burned. However, unless the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy, the process for creating it relies on fossil fuels.\nThe Dornier 228 was retrofitted with a full size prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain, containing two fuel cell stacks, on the aircraft’s left wing. Lithium-ion battery packs amped up support during takeoff, while hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems were placed inside the cabin, with the seats removed.\nHalf the power came from the fuel cells, and half from the battery packs, a company representative confirmed in a post-flight press conference.\nThe right wing carried a regular engine, for safety reasons — although it was not used during the flight.\nStarting from Cotswold Airport, the airplane completed taxi, takeoff, a full pattern circuit and landing all on the hydrogen-electric engine. It reached a speed of 120 knots, or 139 miles per hour. “All systems performed as expected,” the company said in a press release.\nFor a commercial flight, of course, the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems would be housed on the outside of the aircraft. The company now aims to finalize configuration and submit it for certification by the end of the year.\nIn a press conference, a company representative said that there were no plans “at the moment” to install the hydrogen-electric powertrains (the mechanism which drives the plane, including fuel tanks and engine) on both wings, but added “Everything is possible, and we are learning.” The company has yet to confirm its launch aircraft.\nZeroAvia’s flight is part of the UK Government-backed HyFlyer II project, which aims to develop a 600kW powertrain to allow zero-emissions flight for 9-19 seater aircraft, and is targeting a 300 nautical mile range. The flight was conducted under a full Part 21 flight permit with the UK Civil Aviation Authority.\nThe company has come a long way since September 2020, when it completed a hydrogen-electric powered flight of a six-seater Piper Malibu, using a 250kW hydrogen-electric powertrain. It has since completed over 30 flights with the smaller engine.\nThe company — which already has partnerships with seven aircraft manufacturers — has 1,500 pre-orders for differing engine variants, according to founder and CEO Val Miftakhov at the press conference. Up to 700 of them are for the size of engine that was trialed in the UK on Thursday. “We know the market is there for it, it’s now all about pushing this to the final design,” he added.\nThe company aims to be serving commercial flights with the technology by 2025. It also aims to scale up the technology to larger 90-seater aircraft, with “further expansion” into narrowbodies in the next decade, they said in a statement. By 2027, they aim to be able to power a 700-mile flight in a 40-80 seater aircraft.\nThe latter is no simple task.\nWhile hydrogen-powered aircraft have been in development since the mid-20th Century, they have faced significant obstacles, mainly hydrogen’s low energy density by volume compared to kerosene — meaning it would take up about four times the space of jet fuel — and the latter’s availability and historically low price.\nThe infrastructure required to produce and distribute hydrogen is also an issue. At this year’s Airbus Summit, an industry event hosted by the aircraft manufacturer, Airbus boss Guillaume Faury warned that this was “a big concern” and it could derail the company’s plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035.\nAirbus announced plans in December to test a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine on an A380 in 2026.\nDays before Airbus’ announcement, Rolls-Royce and budget airline EasyJet said they had successfully converted a regular airplane engine to run on liquid hydrogen fuel — a world first, they claimed.\nMeanwhile, other companies are developing technology that aims to deliver electric planes. Miftakhov told CNN in 2020 that compared to even the “wildest predictions for battery technology,” hydrogen has greater potential than all-electric rivals for emissions-free flying.\nMeanwhile, ZeroAvia’s Dornier 228 will conduct a series of test flights from Kemble, in the UK’s Lake District, before moving on to demonstration flights from other airports.\nMiftakhov said in a statement: “This is a major moment, not just for ZeroAvia, but for the aviation industry as a whole, as it shows that true zero-emission commercial flight is only a few years away.\n“The first flight of our 19-seat aircraft shows just how scalable our technology is and highlights the rapid progress of zero-emission propulsion. This is only the beginning — we are building the future of sustainable, zero climate impact aviation.”\nIn a press conference, calling it “an outstanding day, not just for ZeroAvia or aviation but for the world,” he added: “Aviation’s [contribution] is becoming larger and larger to climate change and we really need solutions.”\nThe fast-growing industry accounts for 2.1% of manmade carbon emissions worldwide, according to the Air Transport Action Group, and 3.5% of planet-warming emissions in total.\n“Today we have witnessed a major step towards achieving that goal [of decarbonization],” he said in the press conference.\n“There’s still a way to go but let’s celebrate the achievement.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Inside 5 days of a White House determined to maintain business as usual\nBy Phil Mattingly, Chief White House correspondent\nA White House facing the first full day of a special counsel investigation sought to maintain a business-as-usual attitude, highlighting what has become a central objective amid an uncertain and potentially perilous new reality.\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio to the White House, making good on a private pledge two months prior, smiling as he ignored the shouted questions directed his way about the investigation into classified documents found at his home and old private office.\nA carefully choreographed roll-out of warnings and statements from the Treasury Department, House and Senate Democratic leaders and the White House — designed to lay the groundwork for a looming battle with House Republicans over the need to raise the debt ceiling in the months ahead — went ahead as planned.\nTop advisers held their weekly planning and strategy with outside allies, as scheduled.\nAs a small group of Biden’s closest aides and lawyers inside and outside the administration were quietly engaged in an intensive effort to navigate the legal, political and messaging problems that were jarringly thrust to the forefront in the last several days, most inside the West Wing had little to no involvement and were trying to focus on one thing: Normalcy.\nOn Capitol Hill, where Democrats have vacillated between public defense of Biden and private pangs of post-traumatic stress tied to another top Democrat dealing with legal issues tied to classified documents, at least one Democrat subscribed to the effort.\n“Frankly, I don’t think we should focus too much on an issue that I honestly did not hear from a single person at home is their top concern,” Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and one of Biden’s closest allies, told CNN’s Manu Raju. “Their top concern is prices at the pump, prices at the grocery store, gun violence, climate change, jobs, moving our economy forward.”\nAt the close of a week defined by head-spinning developments tied to Biden’s handling of classified information after his time as vice president, it’s a goal that may appear to be aspirational at best.\nYet it’s also one that serves as a necessity for a White House where the vast majority of officials have no role on the team managing legal issues overtaking their carefully crafted plans and messaging.\nBiden’s advisers, shifting back into the familiar posture that was honed on the campaign trail and is defined by a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude driven by criticism from national media and the Twitter accounts they so closely follow, see the last few days as evidence Biden’s broader policy goals and objectives won’t necessarily be bogged down.\nAs senior White House advisers took stock of five days of stunning twists and turns, they maintained it would serve as a roadmap for their path ahead, despite the spotlight of an investigation that is largely out of their control.\nThey repeated the view that the investigation will ultimately show Biden’s lawyers took the proper steps when the classified documents were discovered. There is neither upside nor benefit, they note, in engaging in an issue that is an ongoing legal matter — a position that has been laid bare in each White House press briefing held since the initial news broke.\nThroughout the week, even as new developments surfaced that repeatedly caught Biden’s team off guard, they pointed to the fact they stuck to a strategic plan put together in the weeks leading up to the new year.\nThere was their first move of the new year on an issue with bipartisan overlap and clear political salience — laying down the broad outlines of potential Big Tech reform through a Wall Street Journal opinion piece carrying the president’s byline.\nEach new House Republican legislative effort was met with an immediate, and coordinated, attack from Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill.\nA South Korean solar panel maker’s announcement that it would invest $2.5 billion to build factories in Georgia marked the latest in tens of billions of dollars in new private sector investment incentivized by new laws signed by Biden. Drug price reductions, touted for months before their implementation, kicked in as well.\nSenior administration officials participated in more than 100 regional and coalitions interviews on Biden’s policy priorities over the course of the week.\nAnd on the day the special counsel would be announced, Biden’s top economic officials were repeatedly made available for media appearances on the release of Consumer Price Index data that showed a sixth consecutive month of decline in inflation.\nNational Economic Council Director Brian Deese, in an appearance on CNN less than an hour before Garland’s announcement that former US attorney Robert Hur would be appointed special counsel, was asked if the legal issues were a distraction for Biden’s economic team.\n“Absolutely not,” Deese said. “Our focus, the economic team’s focus, is going to be on continuing progress we’ve made, and today is a good, positive development on the economic side, but will increase our resolve to do the work we need to do on behalf of the American people to bring prices down, keep the economic recovery going.”\nBiden’s schedule was kept the same as well, including his own remarks on the inflation numbers and broader domestic economy. It was a speech advisers viewed as an important marker for Biden — even if it was overshadowed by his willingness to engage on a question about the proximity of his Corvette to the classified documents discovered in his garage.\nBiden was still attending the memorial service for former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter when the special counsel was officially appointed. He would be informed shortly after he departed of Hur’s appointment.\nFor Biden, who entered this year all but certain to seek reelection and with a clear and carefully choreographed strategic plan to highlight his legislative wins — all while isolating and elevating House Republicans — it has been a week in which each progressing day seemed to demonstrate just how quickly the ground can shift under carefully laid plans.\nYet senior White House advisers say they can stick to a plan that as this week began was viewed as both fully operational and critical to their political prospects in the year ahead.\nWhether the determination to stick to those plans as crafted can hold, as an investigation bears down in the months ahead, has yet to be seen.\nBut on day one, as Biden departed the White House as scheduled, his intent to try was clear.\nHe smiled and gestured toward reporters as he walked out onto the South Lawn toward Marine One. But he ignored their shouted questions about the investigation.\nHe would arrive at his Wilmington, Delaware, home a short while later — the same home in which a second batch of classified documents was discovered, an ever-present reminder of an investigation he and his advisers appear determined not to let get in the way of their plans.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "WHO says Covid-19 remains a global health emergency, but pandemic is at a ‘transition point’\nBy Katherine Dillinger, CNN\nCovid-19 remains a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said on Monday, but it acknowledged the pandemic is at a “transition point.”\nWHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee discussed the pandemic on Friday at its 14th meeting on Covid-19, and Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concurred that the public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, declaration should continue.\nIn a statement released on Monday, WHO’s advisory committee said it urged WHO to propose “alternative mechanisms to maintain the global and national focus on COVID-19 after the PHEIC is terminated.”\n“Achieving higher levels of population immunity globally, either through infection and/or vaccination, may limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on morbidity and mortality, but there is little doubt that this virus will remain a permanently established pathogen in humans and animals for the foreseeable future. As such, long-term public health action is critically needed,” the committee said in a statement on Monday. “While eliminating this virus from human and animal reservoirs is highly unlikely, mitigation of its devastating impact on morbidity and mortality is achievable and should continue to be a prioritized goal.”\nIn a list of temporary recommendations, Tedros said countries should continue vaccinating people and incorporate Covid-19 vaccines into routine care; improve disease surveillance; maintain a strong health care system to avoid a “a panic-neglect cycle”; continue to fight misinformation; and adjust international travel measures based on risk assessment.\nThe organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a PHEIC in January 2020, about six weeks before characterizing it as a pandemic.\nA PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHO’s recommendations for managing the emergency. Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency — declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.\nThe US also remains under its own public health emergency declaration, which US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra renewed most recently January 11.\nMore than 170,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the past eight weeks, Tedros said last week when he announced the committee meeting, and even though the world is better equipped to manage the pandemic than it was three years ago, he remains “very concerned by the situation in many countries and the rising number of deaths.”\nWhile global Covid-19 deaths are trending upward, the seven-day average remains significantly lower than previous points of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nLast week, ahead of the committee meeting, Tedros pleaded with countries not to let up on the fight against Covid-19.\n“My message is clear: Do not underestimate this virus,” he said. “It has and will continue to surprise us, and it will continue to kill unless we do more to get health tools to people that need them and to comprehensively tackle misinformation.”\nA ‘wake-up call’ for future outbreaks\nAlso on Monday, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies released two new reports that warned “all countries remain dangerously unprepared for future outbreaks.”\nIFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said the Covid-19 pandemic should be “a wake-up call.”\n“The next pandemic could be just around the corner; if the experience of COVID-19 won’t quicken our steps toward preparedness, what will?,” he said in a news release.\nThe reports say that much of the Covid-19 crisis’ impacts on countries, such as job loss and poverty, learning loss, food insecurity and increased mental health issues could have been avoided if governments invested in emergency preparedness. They recommend countries prepare for simultaneous hazards, such as disease outbreaks and extreme weather events.\n“We need to start preparing now, because our world is becoming increasingly hazardous,” the IFRC’s World Disasters report 2022 said, noting that many of the disasters are propelled by climate change. “In 2021, 378 disasters were recorded — not including disease outbreaks — which is higher than the 20-year average of 337 disasters per year. Many countries had to respond to hazards like hurricanes and floods while also dealing with COVID-19.”\nThe report urges “action at the community level” to prepare for disaster on the front lines, and to address existing economic and racial inequities so that they aren’t exacerbated when disaster strikes.\nThe IFRC’s Everyone Counts Report 2023 also emphasizes “local resilience,” by building up and investing in communities’ “public health, sanitation, shelter and economic security.”\nUltimately, the report states, “Nobody is safe until everybody is safe. The pandemic is not over and nor is the response.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "‘A ginormous can of worms’: How a fight over snow crabs could lead to a win for oil drilling access\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nA legal fight in Norway over snow crabs could end up having big implications for access to oil in the Arctic.\nThis week Norway’s Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether Latvian trawlers are able to catch snow crab — a cold water species whose leg meat is popular in countries including the United States and Japan — in a wide swath of water around Svalbard.\nSvalbard is an archipelago located deep inside the Arctic Circle, roughly halfway between Norway and the North Pole, and home to the world’s most northerly permanently inhabited community.\nUnder the Svalbard Treaty of 1920 — signed by countries including the US, Japan and many European Union countries — Norway has sovereignty over the islands but other signatories have equal rights to the resources in Svalbard’s territorial waters including fish, oil and gas.\nThe question at the heart of this case is how far out into the ocean these rights extend. If the treaty is found to extend to the continental shelf, then signatories would have equal rights to its resources.\n“The ramifications are considerable: snow crab today and oil and gas tomorrow,” Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told CNN.\nThe Arctic may hold 13% of the world’s undiscovered conventional oil resources and 30% of its undiscovered gas resources, according to the US Geological Survey.\nIn the case before the Supreme Court, the Latvian company claims it is entitled to catch snow crab in an extended area of ocean around Svalbard under an EU license but without permission from Norway.\n“They argue that since Norwegian fishermen got a license, they are entitled to a license too,” Øystein Jensen, a research professor at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, a Norwegian research foundation, told CNN.\nNorway, on the other hand, maintains that the treaty provisions for equal rights don’t apply beyond 12 nautical miles of the archipelago. “There is no legal basis for a claim,” Tuva Bogsnes, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN.\nCrabs, which scuttle about on the seafloor, are considered sedentary — unlike fish, which travel more widely — meaning they are deemed for legal purposes to be part of the seafloor. Some believe the case could open the door for the extraction of other seafloor resources such as oil, gas and other minerals.\nIf the Supreme Court decides in favor of the Latvians’ right to fish without a Norwegian license, “it means an obligation to not discriminate with regard to all living and non-living resources on the shelf, including oil drilling activities,” Jensen said. “It’s all or nothing, basically.”\nIt could open up “a ginormous can of worms,” said Rachel Tiller, chief scientist at SINTEF Ocean, an industries research organization. In terms of the bottom of the sea, she added, “that means whatever oil or gas or anything that’s there, anyone should be able to exploit those areas,” though she said it would not be a “free for all,” as Norway would still manage the area.\n“Irrespective of the Court’s ruling on this issue it will be up to the government of Norway to decide whether to open additional areas for petroleum activity,” Bogsnes said. She said there are no current plans to open the area up to extraction.\nNorway, one of Europe’s largest oil and gas producers, announced on Tuesday it planned to offer a record number of oil exploration blocks in the Barents Sea in the Arctic, according to Reuters.\nAs climate change causes the Arctic to heat up and ice to melt, resources may start to become more accessible.\n“Climate change makes the Arctic more attractive for resource exploitation, including around Svalbard. It boosts all states’ interest in the region,” Jensen said. Dodds cautioned, however, that the region’s rapid warming may also make it more unpredictable and expensive for oil and gas extraction.\nIn 2021, the International Energy Agency said there could be no new oil, gas and coal projects if the world is to keep on track for limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050.\nA decision on the Supreme Court case is expected in two to three months.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "What is an atmospheric river?\nBy Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist\nAn atmospheric river is a plume of moisture that helps carry saturated air from the tropics to higher latitudes, delivering unrelenting rain or snow.\nThink of it as a fire hose that aims at — then drenches — a particular region.\nTypically 250 to 375 miles wide, atmospheric rivers can stretch more than a thousand miles long, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.\nIn the western US, they account for 30% to 50% of annual precipitation.\nWhile atmospheric rivers are an incredibly important source of rainfall, they can also bring flash flooding, mudslides and landslides, sometimes killing people and destroying property.\n“When atmospheric rivers pass over land they can cause conditions similar to those of hurricanes with intense and rapid rainfall, cyclone force winds, and significantly increased wave heights,” NOAA says.\nAtmospheric rivers happen all over the world\nTen or more atmospheric rivers can be happening at once across the globe.\nA well-known and strong one is the Pineapple Express, with moisture transported from the tropical Pacific around Hawaii to the US and Canadian West Coasts.\nThe eastern half of the US also experiences atmospheric rivers, with moisture pulled from the Gulf of Mexico.\n“Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,” said Jason Cordeira, associate professor of meteorology at Plymouth State University. “They’re just not as impactful and don’t usually produce as much rainfall.”\nWestern Europe and North Africa also experience frequent atmospheric rivers, as do New Zealand and Australia.\nMost notable atmospheric river events\n• In the winter of 2023, a series of atmospheric rivers sent an unprecedented amount of moisture to drought-parched California. Over roughly three weeks, parts of the state got between 2 and 3 feet of rain. The coast was battered by 30-foot waves, and the state endured 100-mph winds. At least 20 people died.\n• In October of 2021, a strong atmospheric river hit the San Francisco Bay area exceptionally hard. Winds exceeded 80 mph, and 60-foot waves were recorded. In just three days, the storm delivered as much as 15% of annual rainfall to the region.\n• California’s megaflood of 1861 is the state’s most catastrophic atmospheric river. The 43-day pounding by unrelenting rain turned the Central Valley into an inland sea. Thousands of people died, and downtown Sacramento was submerged in 10 feet of water and mudslide debris.\nClimate change and its impact on atmospheric rivers\nAs the world warms, the atmosphere can hold more moisture — which will lead to rainier atmospheric river events.\n“It’s expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor, and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,” Cordeira explained.\n“So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.”\nAtmospheric rivers will be “significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas,” a NASA-led study found.\nThe frequency of the most intense atmospheric rivers will likely double, the study found.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "US ambassador calls on China to be ‘more honest’ about Covid origins\nBy Jennifer Hansler and Jeremy Herb, CNN\nUS Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Monday that China will have to “be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis” if the US and China are going to be able to work together.\nBurns added that the Chinese surveillance balloon and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.”\nBurns’ comments on Covid were made in reference to strengthening the World Health Organization, in response to a question about political polarization in the US and how it impacts America’s standing and ability to tackle geopolitical challenges.\nBurns was speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce event the day after news emerged that the Department of Energy assessed with “low confidence” that the deadly pandemic likely originated from a lab leak. While Burns was not speaking specifically about the latest assessment, the Department of Energy’s new finding underscores how US intelligence agencies remain divided on the origins of the pandemic — in part because Beijing has not been cooperative with efforts to investigate the matter.\nThe latest assessment, which was an update of the intelligence community’s views on the origins of the pandemic, further added to the divide among the 18 intelligence community agencies. In 2021, a declassified intelligence community report found four agencies in the intelligence community assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while the FBI assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident.\nA low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.\nUS diplomats have consistently raised the need for China to be transparent with the world about the origins of Covid-19 but China has not increased transparency, a senior administration official explained.\nWhile the new assessment has resurfaced questions about the origins of the pandemic, Burns said the Chinese surveillance balloon which the US shot down and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.” Burns said it was “a moment where we’ve got to manage these differences, hold China to account and build up our alliance system out here in the Indo-Pacific.”\nBurns noted that the US thought it “had a chance in 2023 for greater stability” coming out of the meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, noting that “a lot of that conversation was focused, frankly, on the differences between us, in our interest, both of us, in trying to manage those differences effectively so that we don’t end up in a conflict, God forbid, between our two countries.”\nThose prospects were stymied when the US detected the Chinese surveillance balloon in American airspace, Burns indicated, noting that, “we’re now in this surreal moment, where the Chinese who I think you know, lost the debate over the balloon, globally lost influence and credibility around the world because of what they have done.”\n“They’re now blaming this on us. It’s a little bit Orwellian. And it’s a little bit frustrating because I think everybody knows the truth here,” Burns said.\nBurns’ call for transparency on Covid-19 in the context of strengthening the WHO — a key global agency tasked with responding to pandemics — was mentioned as part of a catalog of things that Burns said “most Americans” would want Beijing and the US to work together on, including climate change and food security.\nThe State Department has repeatedly called for Beijing to be transparent about the origins of Covid.\n“It’s in everyone’s interest, it’s — including in the interest of the PRC, that they work with the international community, lend a degree of transparency to the international investigations into COVID origins so that neither they nor we nor any country around the world should have to pay this kind of steep cost again,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in November.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "A subsidy arms race is kicking off between Europe and America\nBy Julia Horowitz, CNN\nWhen US President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, he enacted the biggest climate investment in American history — a landmark moment for a nation that pumps more carbon into the atmosphere than any country bar China.\n“Our Department of Energy estimates that the new law will reduce emissions in the United States by about 1 billion tons in 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth,” Biden told world leaders at the UN’s COP27 climate summit in November.\nBut in directing roughly $370 billion in federal funding toward the rapid buildout of clean energy infrastructure, the United States has also kickstarted a global subsidies race, as world leaders claim the package unfairly favors American companies and say they have no choice but to respond with hefty incentives of their own.\nLast week, the European Commission unveiled its Green Deal Industrial Plan, which will marshal more than $270 billion in existing funds toward cutting red tape and delivering tax breaks for net-zero investments. The package was discussed at a meeting of EU leaders this week.\nEurope would push ahead with work “to allow for targeted, temporary and proportionate support to be deployed speedily, including via tax credits, in those sectors that are strategic for the green transition and are adversely impacted by foreign subsidies or high energy prices,” the EU leaders said in a statement on Friday.\nHundreds of billions of dollars in government funding could help countries meet emissions goals that otherwise look increasingly elusive. Yet the emergence of a tit-for-tat approach on green subsidies is also raising concerns about a new era of protectionism, fueling fears that competing industrial policies will fray global ties, hurt trade and reduce necessary collaboration.\nHere’s what you need to know about the rivalry and its potential consequences.\nWhat are subsidies?\nSubsidies are monetary benefits awarded to companies that a government or public body wants to help, in theory because their work benefits the public or has strategic importance.\nThis can take the form of a tax break, a cash grant or loans at below-market rates. Even government procurement deals can function as subsidies if a government agency offers to pay extra for goods or services it could have acquired more cheaply elsewhere.\n“The idea is governments can do something that the markets aren’t doing themselves,” said Stephanie Rickard, a political science professor at the London School of Economics and the author of “Spending to Win,” a book on subsidies. “Either there’s a technology that’s not being created or adopted, or there’s an industry that’s not growing at the rate it might be.”\nCritics argue that governments, which have their own political motivations, aren’t good at picking winners and losers. But with the state taking a much bigger role in the economy since the pandemic, supporters say subsidies have a vital role in tackling the climate crisis. They also note that fossil fuel producers have benefited from them for decades.\nWhy are green subsidies popular?\nOne of the biggest hurdles in efforts to address climate change is the “green premium,” or the difference between what it costs to buy a product or service that uses clean energy versus one with heavy emissions.\nThis premium is expected to shrink as clean energy technologies become more advanced and infrastructure to produce them is scaled up. In the meantime, though, it’s dissuading businesses from choosing greener options, even when they’re available.\nThat’s where companies think government aid can help. They see it as a means to supercharge activity in the private sector and help bring costs down.\n“Innovations need that push in the beginning,” said Nils Aldag, CEO of Sunfire, a German company that builds technology for producing green hydrogen. “They need that market opening.”\nWhat’s in the Inflation Reduction Act?\nMost of the money the IRA has earmarked for clean energy initiatives comes in the form of tax credits. An estimated $43 billion is available for consumers and $216 billion for corporations, according to McKinsey.\nAmerican households can now claim a credit of up to $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump, for example. A credit of up to $7,500 is available for the purchase of a new electric vehicle — though this may require the rewiring of supply chains, given coming stipulations that eligible vehicles need be built in North America, with batteries and components also from North America. There’s $2 billion in grants included to expand domestic manufacturing capacity as demand grows.\nThe law also gives generous tax incentives to businesses that invest in green energy projects, from wind and solar farms to facilities for battery storage and producing renewable hydrogen. Companies have already announced at least $40 billion in capital investment for such projects, along with 20 new facilities or facility expansions, according to the American Clean Power Association, an industry group.\nThis all sounds great. What’s the problem?\nLeaders in Europe have applauded renewed US leadership on climate, but have complained that the IRA is “super aggressive” and even discriminatory. They fear the IRA is tempting green energy businesses from their countries to invest in the United States instead of in their home markets, resulting in a loss of expertise, jobs and tax revenue. Domestic firms that stay put could fall behind as American companies leverage subsidies to quickly ramp up operations.\n“A lot of investors are asking us why we are keeping our operations here,” said Heike Freund, chief operating officer at Marvel Fusion, a German startup developing technology to produce clean energy from fusion power.\nThe European Union has also argued that the IRA’s conditions on tax credits for electric cars violate World Trade Organization rules.\n“This nationalistic approach when it comes to the local content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act is what generates the tension,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.\nWhile the European Union’s outcry has been the loudest, it’s not the only worried party. The United Kingdom, South Korea and Japan have also raised concerns.\nHow are they responding?\nOne challenge for European leaders is how to loosen rules on state aid without creating a new competition for subsidies between member states. That could weaken a core pillar of Europe’s vast internal market.\nIn the meantime, government officials are lobbying the United States to rethink parts of the IRA.\n“There is still a fair chance to reach agreements that will allow European industry to participate [in], and not be excluded from, the Inflation Reduction Act,” German Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters during a visit to Washington this week with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\nThe White House, for its part, emphasizes that the IRA will benefit all countries by reducing the cost of green technologies. It says talks with foreign partners are ongoing.\n“Europe and other allied countries have nothing to fear from the Inflation Reduction Act and quite a bit to gain,” said Brian Deese, Biden’s top economic adviser.\nWhy does it matter?\nWhile greater funding for clean energy production and green technologies is essential, a fight over subsidies runs the risk of focusing too much on geography and not enough on the bigger picture.\nIf a gigafactory that would have been built in Germany is simply stood up in South Carolina instead, that doesn’t make the world more likely to hit its emissions targets, said Aaron Cosbey, a senior associate at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.\nThe fight over green subsidies also comes as geopolitical tensions are pushing countries to focus on greater localization of production — not just for green energy, but also for sensitive technologies like computer chips. China’s subsidies for net-zero sectors “have long been twice as high as those in the EU” relative to the size of the economy, the European Commission said when outlining its new industrial plan.\nThis could accelerate the remaking of supply chains and the global economy over the long term, as national interests trump commitments to open markets.\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the WTO, has warned against this shift, arguing that a subsidy arms race could damage global trade at a moment when it’s needed to spur growth.\n“Let’s not make it [a subsidy war] a reality because of the cost to the global economy,” Okonjo-Iweala told CNN’s Richard Quest in January.\n— Ella Nilsen contributed reporting.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, the US Senate is continuing to educate lawmakers on artificial intelligence in preparation for months of legislative work on the issue.\nIn Wednesdayâs remarks during a meeting of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Biden described the recent conversations heâs had with AI leaders and experts.\nâVast differences exist among them in terms of what potential it has, what dangers there are, and so, I have a keen interest in AI,â Biden said. âIâve convened key experts on how to harness the power of artificial intelligence for good while protecting people from the profound risk it also presents.â\nâWe canât kid ourselves,â Biden continued. â[There is] profound risk if we donât do it well.â\nBiden reiterated the United Statesâ commitment to working with international partners including the United Kingdom on developing safeguards for artificial intelligence.\nThe meeting also saw presidential advisers showcasing to Biden several use cases for artificial intelligence. Maria Zuber, the panelâs co-chair, said the examples Biden would see during the meeting would include the use of AI to predict extreme weather linked to climate change; to âcreate materials that have properties weâve never been able to create beforeâ; and to âunderstand the origins of the universe, which is literally as big as it gets.â\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Fossils reveal the mysterious primate relatives that lived in the ancient Arctic\nBy Ashley Strickland, CNN\nAnalysis of fossils found in the far north of Canada has revealed that two previously unknown species of ancient near-primates lived above the Arctic Circle some 52 million years ago, according to new research.\nThe now-extinct creatures belonged to a part of the primate family tree that branched off before the ancestors of lemurs diverged from the common ancestors of monkeys, apes and humans, said study coauthor Dr. Chris Beard, a distinguished foundation professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Kansas and senior curator at the university’s Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum.\nThe two sister species lived on what is now Ellesmere Island in northern Canada. They are the first known primatomorphans, or primate relatives, to have lived in latitudes north of the Arctic Circle, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.\nThe two species have been named Ignacius mckennai and Ignacius dawsonae.\n“To get an idea of what Ignacius looked like, imagine a cross between a lemur and a squirrel that was about half the size of a domestic cat,” Beard said. “Unlike living primates, Ignacius had eyes on the sides of its head (instead of facing forward like ours) and it had claws on its fingers and toes instead of nails.”\nWhen researchers analyzed the fossil fragments, the jawbones and teeth of Ignacius seemed different from other primatomorphans that lived in North America’s more southerly reaches.\n“What I’ve been doing the past couple of years is trying to understand what they were eating, and if they were eating different materials than their middle-latitude counterparts,” said lead study author Kristen Miller, a doctoral student at the University of Kansas’ Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum.\nThe Arctic primatomorphans evolved special features in their jaws and teeth to chomp on harder foods, like nuts and seeds, as opposed to their preferred diet of ripe fruit. This physical adaptation was likely because for half of the year, the species lived in the darkness of Arctic winter, when food was much more difficult to find.\n“That, we think, is probably the biggest physical challenge of the ancient environment for these animals,” Beard said.\nThese findings could also be used to understand how animals adapt and evolve amid periods of climate change â as with species facing the human-driven climate crisis today.\nNorthward bound\nResearchers believe the primatomorphans descended from an ancestor species that trekked north from the more southerly regions of North America. Similar fossils have been found across Wyoming, Texas, Montana and Colorado, according to Miller.\n“No primate relative has ever been found at such extreme latitudes,” Miller said. “They’re more usually found around the equator in tropical regions. I was able to do a phylogenetic analysis, which helped me understand how the fossils from Ellesmere Island are related to species found in midlatitudes of North America.”\nThe common ancestor of the two Ignacius species likely reached Ellesmere Island around 51 million years ago, Beard said. At the time, it was a peninsula jutting into the Arctic Sea from adjacent parts of North America.\nIgnacius mckennai and Ignacius dawsonae are named in part after two of Beard’s former colleagues and mentors, he explained: the late paleontologists Dr. Mary Dawson of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh and Dr. Malcolm McKenna of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, both of whom worked extensively on Ellesmere Island.\nGreater physical size for survival\nDuring these ancient times, the Arctic Circle was a warmer, more hospitable place for life. Global warming had caused the region to be much warmer and wetter, with a swamplike environment. The warmer temperatures during this period likely encouraged Igancius’ ancestor to venture north.\n“Winter temperatures may have gotten as low as freezing for short periods of time, but we know that there were hardly ever any sustained freezing temperatures because crocodilians have been found on Ellesmere Island, and they cannot survive long freezes,” Beard said. “In the summertime, temperatures reached about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.”\nDespite the warmer temperatures, the primatomorphans still had to adapt to survive in their unique northern ecosystem. They grew bigger than their southern relatives, who resembled squirrels; such growth commonly happens in mammals living in northern latitudes because it helps them maintain the needed core body temperature, Beard said.\n“(The findings) tells us to expect dramatic and dynamic changes to the Arctic ecosystem as it transforms in the face of continued warming,” Beard said. “Some animals that don’t currently live in the Arctic will colonize that region, and some of them will adapt to their new environment in ways that parallel Ignacius. Likewise, we can expect some of the new colonists to diversify in the Arctic, just as Ignacius did.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "story_text": "DC’s cherry blossoms coming early due to confusing weather\nBy ASHRAF KHALIL\nAssociated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The cherry trees in the nation’s capital are confused by Earth’s changing climate, with the iconic blossoms appearing earlier than expected because of the unusually warm winter.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the National Park Service announced Wednesday that Washington’s 3,700 cherry blossom trees would reach peak bloom this year from March 22-25. That’s several days earlier than observers and experts had expected.\n“This has been a challenging year to read the trees,” said Jeff Reinbold, NPS superintendent for the national mall and memorial parks. One of the warmest winters on record, plus dramatic fluctuations in temperature have essentially sent confusing signals to the trees.\nThe district’s winter featured dramatic temperature shifts, including a week in February where it hit 81 degrees one day and briefly snowed two days later. The end results, Reinbold said, are trees that he compared to a hormonal teenager. “There’s a lot going on in there,” he said.\nThe early bloom, by itself, isn’t a huge problem, unless the temperatures drop suddenly again now that the vulnerable blossoms are emerging. “An early frost would definitely damage the blossoms,” Reinbold said.\nCherry Blossom Festival President Diana Mayhew said this year’s bloom dates aren’t unprecedented, but they’re the second earliest she had witnessed in 23 years with the organization. As a result, her organization has accelerated their own timetable, moving up multiple events planned at the Tidal Basin by a week.\nMayhew said she and city officials are expecting a boom year for the festival, which typically signals the unofficial start of D.C.’s tourist season. The 2020 cherry blossom season was essentially wrecked in real time by the creeping shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was moving across the country just as the festival was holding press conferences to announce that year’s peak bloom. Organizers finally were forced to cancel most in-person events.\nWashington’s cherry blossoms date back 111 years to an original 1912 gift of 3,000 trees from the mayor of Tokyo. The Japanese embassy has remained deeply involved in their maintenance and in the annual festival — organizing a host of cherry blossom-themed events and performances.\nKoichi Ai, head of chancery for the Japanese Embassy, said Wednesday that the trees hold “special status” within Japanese culture. Their brief but spectacular bloom cycle represents, “the transient nature of beauty and the everlasting cycle of life,” he said.\nThe 2021 Cherry Blossom Festival took place fully under pandemic restrictions with organizers offering online bloom-cams and multiple virtual events and activities. Last year’s season drew an estimated 1.1 million visitors — close to the pre-pandemic average of 1.5 million. This year, Mayhew said she hopes to match or exceed those pre-pandemic numbers.\nIn their ongoing quest to maintain and protect the trees, NPS officials have to contend with a second climate change-related issue — regular flooding in the Tidal Basin due to rising seas levels. The 107-acre man-made reservoir where the largest concentration of trees is located now floods twice a day at high tide, submerging a stretch of sidewalk next to the Jefferson Memorial. During heavy rains that routinely occur in Washington, the floodwaters completely overflow the sea wall in multiple locations and soak the tree roots with salty brackish water.\nThe original 1880s design of the Tidal Basin also simply wasn’t equipped to handle the kinds of crowds and traffic the area now receives. That traffic has only increased as more monuments have been added to the Tidal Basin area over the years: a memorial to Franklin Roosevelt opened in 1997, and the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial was inaugurated in 2011.\nIn 2019, the NPS, along with the Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, launched a long-term project to rebuild the basin’s deteriorating sea wall and modify and expand sidewalks to accommodate modern crowds. Reinbold on Wednesday said the funding for the project had been secured and the proposed changes were in the design stage.\nThe twin impacts of confusing temperature shifts and Tidal Basin flooding represent a potential long-term threat to the health of the trees, according to Chris Walsh, a professor emeritus of horticulture at the University of Maryland. Warmer winters and fluctuating temperatures, he said, are producing similar early blooms this year in other flowering fruit trees such as apricots and pears.\n“Everything’s ahead of schedule this year,” he said.\nSince the cherry blossom trees aren’t relied on to produce fruit, the impact on them should be minimal and won’t harm the flowers — provided that there isn’t a sudden cold snap. However, Walsh said the arboreal confusion could impact the annual development of protective bark, which could ultimately “put a lot of stress on the trees” and shorten their lifespan.\n“If you add the stress of the fluctuating temperatures to the stress of salt on the roots, now you have two problems,” he said.",

        "story_text": "Why Bidenâs ban on drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge likely wonât affect gas prices\nBy Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — There are many reasons why gas prices could shoot up in the near future, but the Biden administrationâs ban on oil drilling on millions of acres in Alaska in unlikely to be one of them.\nThe ban, announced on Wednesday, cancels seven Trump-era oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and prevents drilling on more than 13 million acres in the federal National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. President Joe Biden said his motivation for the bans was to protect and preserve the region in the face of climate change.\nGiven a limited amount of drilling was taking place there prior to the ban, thereâs a slim chance consumers will feel more pain at the pump from this, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nâThis is primarily about optics,â he said. Most oil companies didnât bother bidding on the drilling leases in anticipation that theyâd be canceled, he added. On top of which, many steered clear of the area because there wasnât sufficient infrastructure. âThereâs little power to drill, pipeline to carry the crude oil, roads and everything needed basically to drill for oil,â he told CNN.\nThe ban on drilling in the region would ânot at allâ hurt consumers in the future, De Haan said.\nIn contrast, oil production cuts in Russia and Saudi Arabia that were announced earlier this week are having immediate impacts, lifting Brent crude oil above $91 a barrel for the first time in 10 months. Brent crude is the international oil price benchmark and is produced in the North Sea.\nMeanwhile, extreme summer heat has prevented many US refineries from operating at full capacity, leading to elevated gas prices throughout the peak driving season. Prices have come down slightly after Labor Day weekend. The national average for regular gasoline was $3.80 a gallon on Thursday compared to $3.83 a week prior, according to AAA data.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Coffee is in danger. Starbucks is working on solutions\nBy Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Coffee is a finicky crop â arabica coffee, the most popular variety, in particular. And climate change poses a huge threat to the coffee business and to farmers.\nâTo grow properly, coffee crops require specific temperature, light and humidity levels,â according to the Inter-American Development Bank, a financial institution serving Latin America and the Caribbean. Currently, those conditions are largely met in certain parts of Latin America, within a region called the coffee belt, a recent IADB report noted.\nBut by 2050, the bank warned, ârising temperatures will reduce the area suitable for growing coffee by up to 50%.â The changing climate could mean that some countries could newly accommodate coffee, IADB noted.\nBut for coffee to keep thriving where it is now, things have to change.\nSo Starbucks, which says it purchases about 3% of all the worldâs coffee, is developing new arabica varietals that are specifically cultivated to hold up better on a warming planet. For more than 10 years, agronomists at Starbucks have been breeding different types of coffee trees, trying to find ones that will yield a high amount of fruit in a relatively short amount of time and, among other things, resist coffee leaf rust, a disease that attacks coffee trees and is exacerbated by climate change.\nAfter pairing hundreds of varieties, the company has landed on six that fit the bill and meet the companyâs standards for taste and flavor. A catalog describing Starbucksâ six new varieties is available to farmers at the companyâs Hacienda Alsacia coffee farm, an educational and research center in Costa Rica.\nThe catalog lists the flavor profile for each plant. One makes coffee with notes of melon, honey and sugar cane, while another boasts a citrus, herbal, floral flavor. The catalog also outlines the plantâs growing characteristics, like the altitudes at which it will survive, the plantâs size and structure, and how many years it will take until first production.\nâSome of the varietals that weâre working with and testing are seeing their harvest in [a] two-year cycle,â instead of three or four years, said Michelle Burns, executive vice president of global coffee, social impact and sustainability for Starbucks. If all goes well, that means more coffee more quickly, a win for Starbucks and its suppliers.\nClimate comes for coffee\nStarbucks, with nearly 36,000 locations across the globe is heavily reliant on farmers â it buys from about 400,000 farmers across 30 countries. They, along with other coffee farmers across the globe, are struggling to adapt to global warming.\nClimate change has had a big impact on Suzanne Shriner, president of Lions Gate Farms in Hawaii, which isnât a Starbucks supplier.\nâOur rainfalls [have] become more intermittent, and when they come, theyâre more severe, which is hard on the plants,â she said.\nIn Hawaii, Shriner said, farmers are working with World Coffee Research, a nonprofit that partners with the industry, including Starbucks, to to come up with a solution to coffee leaf rust, which has become a serious problem in the region.\nâWeâre looking for similar breeding innovations,â she said, âweâre watching the Starbucks program closely.â\nCoffee is not the only crop threatened by climate change, of course. Drought, freeze or heavy rains can devastate yields across agricultural products from cocoa to grapes. And extreme weather is unpredictable, making it difficult for farmers to plan for these changes effectively.\nBut arabica coffee, the only variety used by Starbucks, is especially at risk.\nFighting leaf rust\nWith arabica coffee, there is an âurgent needâ to develop more climate-resistant varieties, said Miguel Gomez, a food marketing professor at Cornellâs Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management.\nCurrent arabica plants âare not resistant to water stresses,â he said. âThey tend to be more susceptible to diseases like leaf rust â¦ that are present whenever you have unusually high temperatures.â\nA coffee rust-resistant tree may be an attractive option for farmers. But itâs not going to fix the many problems posed by climate change, warned Monika Firl, senior advisor for Fairtrade Internationalâs coffee program.\nâNo silver bullet is going to fix climate change for farmers,â she said.\nNature âadapts faster than the laboratory science does,â she added. Breeds that are optimized to thrive in certain conditions might falter in others â and so a solution might work for now, but not in the long term.\nFirl thinks that in order for coffee to be sustainable, there needs to be a shift away from the industrialized coffee farm model. âWe need to bring coffee back to its forest roots,â she said, to promote a healthy ecosystem.\nIn 2021, Starbucks made a commitment to invest in in forest protection and restoration, and set other climate-related goals. Burns described the companyâs breeding program as an âongoingâ process, saying the company will keep trying out new varietals to adapt to climate change.\nOther coffee varieties, like robusta and liberica, hold up better than arabica in these difficult conditions. But coffee makers tend to avoid these varieties because consumers like how arabica tastes and smells, Cornellâs Gomez noted. The goal is to develop varieties that taste like arabica but are more resilient, like other varieties.\nSecuring the coffee supply chain\nIn its most recent annual report, Starbucks pointed to âincreases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beansâ¦ or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans,â as a supply chain risk that could have âan adverse impact on our business and financial results.â\nIt pointed to a number of factors that can affect coffee prices and supply. Bad weather, decreased water availability and crop diseases, among other problems, can all make coffee more expensive for Starbucks to buy, or limit supply altogether. âClimate change may further exacerbate many of these factors,â the report warned.\nEven before Starbucks developed its own climate-resistant varieties, it had been offering climate-resistant seeds developed by others (and sometimes tweaked by Starbucks) to farmers.\nIt has given away three million seeds annually over the past five years, according to the company. In addition to the seeds, Starbucks has distributed about 70 million coffee rust resistant trees to farmers, as part of its goal to give out 100 million trees by 2025.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Six Flags and Cedar Fair operate in different parts of the North America, so a combined company could help them better manage seasonal dips in park attendance.\nIn addition Cedar Point, its flagship theme park in Sandusky, Ohio, Cedar Fair owns Knottâs Berry Farm in California, Schlitterbahn water park in Texas and Canadaâs Wonderland in Ontario. Six Flags primarily operates under its own banner with about 20 parks in the US, two in Mexico and one in Canada.\nCedar Fair said the combined company will allow management to ramp up investments in the parks, which should help boost demand.\nThe new company will keep the Six Flags name, but will trade under Cedar Fairâs stock ticker FUN.\nMerging the companies gives them scale amid the consumer cutting back their spending, climate change, and well-known rivals like SeaWorld, Comcast-owned Universal Studios and Disney, with the latter recently announcing a $60 billion investment in its parks.\nAttendance at theme parks are struggling since the pandemic. Wait times for rides and attractions and Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando in Florida were short this summer for several reasons, including extreme weather and heat in Florida, a waning post-pandemic travel boom and a tense political climate in Florida that has prompted travel warnings from some groups.\nCombining the companies will result in $200 million in cost savings, according to their projections, with more than half of those savings coming from administrative and operational cost savings. Itâs also forecast to generate $3.4 billion in revenue.\nCedar Fair (FUN) shareholders will get one share of stock of the newly combined company for each share owned, and Six Flags (SIX) shareholders will receive 0.58 shares for every share currently owned.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Exxon accurately predicted global warming from 1970s — but continued to cast doubt on climate science, new report finds\nBy Laura Paddison, CNN\nExxonMobil’s own scientists accurately predicted future global warming in reports dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, despite the company publicly continuing for years to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against climate action, according to a new analysis.\nResearchers examined climate projections produced between 1977 and 2003 by Exxon, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. They found the company’s science was not only good enough to predict long term temperature rise, but also accurately predicted when human-caused climate change would become discernible, according to the report published Thursday in the journal Science.\nA slew of internal Exxon documents unearthed by researchers and journalists over the past few years have shown that the company was aware of the link between fossil fuels and climate change at least as far back as the 1970s.\nBut until now, there hasn’t been an in-depth review of Exxon’s own climate modeling data, said Geoffrey Supran, a research fellow in the history of science at Harvard University and a co-author of the report.\nThis is “the first-ever systematic assessment of the fossil fuel industry’s climate projections,” Supran told CNN.\nThe researchers analyzed more than 100 reports by Exxon scientists, produced between 1977 and 2014. They then whittled these down to 12 documents containing climate projections and compared them against historical observations.\nBetween 63% to 83% of the projections were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming and their projections were also consistent with independent academic models, the report found.\nThe company’s climate modeling showed “shocking skill and accuracy,” Supran said.\nExxon projected an average warming of around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, according to the report.\n“That allows us for the first time to put a number on what Exxon knew, namely that fossil fuel burning was going to hit the planet by 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade,” Supran said.\nExxon was “on the money” on various other topics, said Supran, including accurately predicting that human-caused climate change would be first detectable around the year 2000, as well as estimating how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming.\n“I see this as ‘Exxon knew 2.0,'” Supran said, referring to the #ExxonKnew campaign launched by climate activists in the wake of earlier revelations that Exxon has long known about the link between its products and climate change.\n“We now have tight, unimpeachable evidence that ExxonMobil accurately predicted global warming years before it turned around and publicly attacked climate science,” Supran said.\nTodd Spitler, a spokesperson for Exxon, said in a statement that “ExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses,” and “those who talk about how ‘Exxon knew’ are wrong.”\nAddressing Exxon’s climate research, Spitler said the company has produced “nearly 150 papers, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications that the Company has made available to the public.”\n“ExxonMobil’s understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community,” he said.\nCasting ‘doubt and uncertainty’\nDespite its own modeling showing fossil fuel use would lead to global warming, Exxon’s public communications raised doubt about climate change, including taking out ads in major publications suggesting climate science was poorly understood and scientists were divided.\n“When the company was making these claims about doubt and uncertainty through at least the early 2010s, they were doing so in full awareness that their own science contradicted those claims,” Supran said.\nA 2017 peer-reviewed study, which Supran co-authored, examined nearly 190 public and private communications from the company and found that while the majority of internal documents acknowledged human-caused global warming, most of its public statements expressed doubt.\nExxon rejected these findings at the time as “inaccurate and preposterous.”\nIn 2021, a then Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, was captured on an undercover video appearing to confirm that the company sought to undermine climate action.\n“Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes,” McCoy said in the video, filmed by Unearthed, Greenpeace UK’s investigative journalism arm.\nExxon condemned McCoy’s statements at the time, saying that they did not reflect the company’s position on climate.\nThe company, which made a record $58 billion in profits in 2022 according to preliminary data, has since expressed a commitment to the Paris climate agreement pledge to keep global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It has also committed to reach net-zero emissions for its operated assets by 2050 — meaning it will remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as its operations emit.\n“ExxonMobil is actively engaged in efforts to reduce emissions while providing affordable energy to the communities that need it,” Spitler said.\nExxon was one of the companies highlighted in a year-long investigation in the US by the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee into climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies, published in December. It found that the industry is “posturing on climate issues while avoiding real commitments.” At the time, Spitler issued a statement saying the committee took internal Exxon communications out of context, saying they represented “well intended, internal policy debates.”\nClimate litigation\nThe report’s findings could potentially help support climate litigation against Exxon, Daniel Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. (According to the study‘s disclosures, one of the authors had previously served as a paid consultant to a law firm that has filed legal complaints against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies, though that law firm “played no role in this or any other study by the authors,” including in their funding.)\nCities, counties and states across the United States have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, accusing them of deceiving the public about their role in accelerating climate change. Exxon has said these lawsuits have no merit.\n“The more we learn about industry deception, the stronger the legal claims will be,” he said.\nThursday’s analysis could also alter public perceptions of the company, Farber said: “Over time the company’s image may erode as the stream of disclosures eats away at its reputation.”\nThis story has been updated to note the study’s competing interests disclosure.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "New Zealand’s biggest city braces for more heavy rains after deadly floods\nBy Tara Subramaniam, CNN\nNew Zealand authorities warned Monday that the situation in flood-hit Auckland was likely to worsen after “unprecedented” rainfall brought devastating floods that have killed at least four people and forced hundreds to evacuate in the country’s largest city.\nOn Monday, New Zealand’s weather authority issued a red heavy rain warning — the highest level reserved for extreme weather events — for Auckland and the nearby Northland region for the coming days.\n“Tuesday is the day we are most concerned about,” the MetService told CNN. “We are really concerned for the areas north of Auckland. They seem to bear the brunt of the next heavy rainfall event.”\nLuis Fernandes, a meteorologist at the MetService, said the heavy rainfall would also put Auckland at risk of land slips, which are similar to landslides.\n“When you have a significant rainfall event like this, rivers can rise quickly, and roads can literally fall away or become covered and can cut off communities,” he said.\nAn estimated 240 millimeters of rainfall (9.8 inches) — equal to an entire summer’s worth of rain — fell on Auckland Friday, making it the city’s wettest day on record.\nScientists have been warning for years that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. On Sunday night, New Zealand Climate Change Minister James Shaw underscored the link, tweeting “This is climate change” in a post thanking those assisting with flood relief efforts.\nThe north of New Zealand’s North Island is also receiving more rain than normal due to the La Niña climate pattern cycles in the Pacific Ocean that affect weather worldwide.\nAnd the MetService said another 80 to 120 mm of rainfall was expected over the next few days.\nAuckland’s deputy mayor Desley Simpson told CNN Sunday this amount of rain is “pretty unprecedented for Auckland.”\n“We have had more rain in four hours than we have had ever in the history of Auckland since we have started measuring rainfall,” she said.\nMeanwhile, New Zealand police said Sunday that the body of a man declared missing after being swept away by floodwaters Friday is believed to have been found.\nA drone operator located the body in the Onewhero area, south of Auckland, about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) downstream from where he went missing, police said.\nOn Monday, New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said there had been “very significant damage across Auckland.”\n“Obviously there were a number of homes damaged by flooding but also extensive earth movements,” he told public broadcaster TVNZ. Some 350 people needed emergency accommodation, he added.\nThe rain also caused widespread travel disruption over the weekend.\nMore than 2,000 people stayed overnight Friday in the airport’s terminals due to the flooding, the airport said. Domestic flights resumed Saturday but the international terminal was not operational until Sunday.\nAll classes in Auckland have been canceled until February 7, Auckland MP Chlöe Swarbrick said Monday.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Clean energy stocks have fallen out of favor. They face more challenges ahead\nBy Krystal Hur, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Clean energy stocks are out of vogue, as higher interest rates and lagging efforts to combat climate change dog the sector. Those obstacles might not go away anytime soon.\nThe iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund, which tracks the performance of sectors from renewable electricity to semiconductors to solar energy, has slumped 27% this year, underperforming the MSCI All-Country World indexâs 15% gain. The fund is on pace for its third straight annual loss.\nPlug Power shares have slipped 63% this year, Enphase Energy shares have plunged 60%, SolarEdge Technologies shares have declined 71% and NextEra Energy shares have slid 29%.\nThe Biden administrationâs sweeping Inflation Reduction Act promised $750 billion in funding for health and climate projects. Since its passage last year, more than 270 new clean energy projects have been announced, with $132 billion in private investments, according to a Bank of America report released in August.\nYet clean energy stocks havenât recovered, despite hopes that an influx of US government spending on climate solutions would help revive the sector.\nThe culprit behind clean energy stocksâ poor returns? Interest rates are perched at a 22-year high after the Federal Reserve began its aggressive rate hiking campaign last March, driving up borrowing costs for growing companies trying to load up on capital. Supply chain snarls have further complicated matters.\nMoney managers say that while some clients are interested in owning shares of sustainability-driven companies, those challenges make it difficult to simultaneously maximize portfolio returns.\nExpectations that rates will remain elevated at least through the beginning of 2024 could keep the lid on those firmsâ earnings. Clean energy names tend to trade on their future earnings potential, since theyâre part of a fledgling sector. But there are concerns that these stocks are pricey relative to their current balance sheets, despite their steep decline this year.\nâThere are some really rosy assumptions being baked into the share pricesâ of clean energy companies, said Todd Jones, chief investment officer at Gratus Capital.\nJean Rosenbaum, senior portfolio manager at GYL Financial Synergies, says her firm has pared back its clean energy exposure in recent months on concerns about weakening corporate earnings due to elevated rates. Clean energy investments make up under 5% of her firmâs assets.\nSome investors say that the slow global transition to clean energy has also dampened their enthusiasm.\nEight years have passed since the Paris Agreement was approved to slow Earthâs warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or more ideally to 1.5 degrees. Since then, in part because of the lack of specific action laid out in the plan, the more than 190 countries part of that agreement have made little headway in achieving those goals.\nAndrew Poreda, vice president at Sage Advisory, says that higher rates have also hurt consumers seeking a transition to using clean energy. Switching to a residential solar system, for example, requires thousands of dollars that might be sought in a loan, now possibly prohibitive due to high borrowing costs, he says.\nThatâs not to say investors are giving up entirely on sustainability investing.\nPeter Krull, director of sustainable investments at Earth Equity Advisors, manages a portfolio that focuses on stocks in industries from alternative energy to battery technology to green transportation.\nThat portfolio has overall outperformed the MSCI World All Cap Index since its creation in 2012, though its taken a hit in recent years. Krull sees the current rut in clean energy stocks as a buying opportunity for investors.\nClean energy stocks also arenât the only way investors are putting their cash to work with a sustainability mindset. Shares of Nvidia, the artificial intelligence powerhouse that has soared 220% this year, are part of Krullâs firmâs portfolio.\nArtificial intelligence has dominated Wall Street this year, powering monster gains in shares of mega-tech companies. Experts say that AI will be a key tool in accelerating climate change solutions from reducing pollution to replanting.\nâA lot of peopleâs impression of sustainable investing is buying solar or buying wind, but at the end of the day, itâs more about the systems that we can improve,â Krull said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "“A little scary:” Iditarod begins with smallest field ever\nBy MARK THIESSEN\nAssociated Press\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The second half-century for the world’s most famous sled dog race is getting off to a rough start.\nOnly 33 mushers will participate in the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Saturday, the smallest field ever to take their dog teams nearly 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) over Alaska’s unforgiving wilderness. This year’s lineup is smaller even than that of the 34 mushers who lined up for the very first race in 1973.\nThe small pool of mushers is raising concerns about the future of an iconic race that has taken hits from the pandemic, climate change, inflation and the loss of deep-pocketed sponsors, just as multiple big-name mushing champions are retiring with few to take their place.\nThe largest field ever was 96 mushers in 2008; the average number of mushers starting the race over the last 50 years was 63.\n“It’s a little scary when you look at it that way,” said four-time winner Martin Buser, 64, who retired after completing his 39th race last year. “Hopefully it’s not a state of the event and … it’s just a temporary lull.”\nThe Iditarod is the most prestigious sled dog race in the world, taking competitors over two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and treacherous Bering Sea ice in frigid temperatures before ending in the old Gold Rush town of Nome. The roughly 10-day event begins with a “ceremonial start” in Anchorage on Saturday, followed by the competitive start in Willow, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) to the north, on Sunday.\nAnd while the world-renowned race has the highest winner’s purse of any sled dog competition, the winner only pockets about $50,000 before taxes — a payout that is less appealing amid inflation and the continued reverberations of the pandemic.\nMany mushers supplement their income by offering uniquely Alaska experiences to cruise ship passengers, but for several years the pandemic has meant fewer summer visitors to shell out money for a sled dog ride on a glacier.\n“There’s a lot of kennels and a lot of mushers that rely on that to keep going,” said Aaron Burmeister, a Nome native who is sitting out this year’s race to spend more time with family. Burmeister, who works construction, has had eight top 10 finishes in the last decade.\n“Being able to race the Iditarod and the expense of putting together a race team became more than they could bear to maintain themselves,” he said of mushers.\nInflation has also taken a toll, and several mushers said they’d like to see a higher prize purse to attract younger competitors.\nDefending champion Brent Sass, who supplements his income as a wilderness guide, isn’t surprised some mushers are taking a break to build up bank accounts.\nSass, who has 58 dogs, orders 500 bags of high-quality dog food a year. Each bag cost $55 a few years ago, but that has swelled to $85 per bag — or about $42,500 total a year. That’s about how much money Sass pocketed from his Iditarod win last year.\n“You got to be totally prepared to run Iditarod, and have enough money in the bank to do it,” said Sass, who lives in Eureka, about a four-hour drive north of Fairbanks.\nWith other race costs, Buser said running the Iditarod now can mean spending $250,000 to win a $40,000 championship.\nThe race itself has suffered under the increased inflation, Iditarod CEO Rob Urbach said. Supply costs have gone up about 30%, he said, and last year it cost nearly $30,000 to transport specially certified straw from the lower 48 for dogs to sleep on at race checkpoints.\nThe Iditarod also continues to be dogged by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has targeted the race’s biggest sponsors. Over the past decade, Alaska Airlines, ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo have ended race sponsorships after being targeted by PETA.\nPETA took out full-page newspaper ads in Anchorage and Fairbanks in February with a husky — the predominate sled dog breed — prominently featured with the headline, “We don’t want to go to the Iditarod. We just want the Iditarod to go.”\nBut Urbach said the race’s financial health is good, and payouts should be a little higher this year. The top 20 finishers receive payouts on a sliding scale, and every other finisher gets $1,049, reflecting the stated mileage of the race, though the actual mileage is lower.\nUrbach noted they are paying “the healthiest prize money” among competitive sled dog races and called the PETA campaign “pretty offensive, I think, to most Alaskans.”\nThere’s also worry about the future of the race because of climate change.\nThe warming climate forced organizers to move the starting line 290 miles (467 kilometers) north from Willow to Fairbanks in 2003, 2015 and 2017 because of a lack of snow in the Alaska Range. Poor winter conditions and urban growth likewise led the Iditarod to officially move the start from Wasilla about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north to Willow in 2008, even though Wasilla last hosted the start in 2002.\nMoving the start of the race north will likely become more common as global warming advances, said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Ice on Alaska’s western coast could also get thinner and more dangerous, he said.\n“It doesn’t have to be that there’s waves crashing on the beach,” Thoman said of the impacts of ice melt. “It just has to be at the point where the ice is not stable.”\nAs challenges stack up, several veteran mushers with multiple championships have stepped away this year after decades of braving the frigid and windy conditions to train in the dead of the Alaska winter for the Iditarod. They are finding that few are willing to take their place, at least this year.\n“I just got back from Cancun to see the Grateful Dead play on the beaches of Mexico,” said four-time champion Jeff King, who is now 67. “I first said I was going to retire at 40, and I ran the race at 66, so I don’t feel like I’m bailing on anybody.”\nFive-time champion Dallas Seavey said last year’s race would be his last, at least for a while, to spend time with his daughter. Other past champions not racing include Dallas’ father, three-time champion Mitch Seavey, and Joar Leifseth Ulsom and Thomas Waerner, who have one title each.\nWaerner said sponsors are holding back, and it’s too expensive to pay $60,000 to get his team from Norway to Alaska.\nLance Mackey, another four-time champion, died last year from cancer. He is the honorary musher for this year’s race, and his children, Atigun and Lozen, will ride in the first sled to leave the ceremonial start line in Anchorage and during the competitive start Sunday.\nThat leaves two former winners in this year’s field, Sass and Pete Kaiser.\nSass said he is confident the Iditarod will survive this downturn.\n“If we can just keep the train rolling forward, I think it’s going to come back, and hopefully our world can get things under control and things maybe get a little less expensive,” Sass said. “I think that’s going to help get our numbers back up.”",

        "story_text": "Rupert Murdoch steps down as Fox and News Corp. chairman, sending shockwaves through media and politics\nBy Oliver Darcy, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Rupert Murdoch, the powerful right-wing media mogul who built and oversaw one of the worldâs most influential news empires, announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of his companies, Fox Corporation and News Corporation.\nâFor my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change,â Murdoch, 92, wrote in a memo to employees. âBut the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams.â\nAs the leader of Fox and News Corporation, which publishes influential broadsheets such as The Wall Street Journal and tabloid New York Post, Murdoch has for decades commanded considerable influence in the Republican Party, matched by only a select few.\nHis retirement comes at a key moment in the media industry as entrenched entertainment giants confront a sweeping transformation of the traditional television and film business and consumers rapidly gravitate toward streaming services.\nMurdochâs decision to step down as chairman of his companies will also send shockwaves through the political world, just as the 2024 presidential race heats up. Fox News remains ensnared in litigation stemming from the networkâs peddling of former President Donald Trumpâs election lies in the wake of the 2020 election.\nLachlan Murdoch steps in\nStepping into his shoes, Murdochâs eldest son, Lachlan, who already serves as chief executive of Fox Corporation, will become sole chairman of both companies.\nMurdoch described Lachlan as âa passionate, principled leader.â Itâs unclear if Foxâs direction will change under Lachlan, but Rupert signaled that Lachlan will maintain the right-wing editorial bent his media companies are known for.\nâMy father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,â Murdoch told employees in his memo. âSelf- serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who would question their provenance and purpose. Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.â\nRupert Murdoch, who assured staffers he is in ârobust health,â said that in his new role as chairman emeritus he would still be âinvolved every day in the contest of ideas.â\nHowever, Lachlan Murdoch has privately criticized Trump, saying that he disagrees with much of the way the former President behaves, people familiar with the matter told CNN last year. In some comments, Murdoch had gone as far as to tell people that he believes if Trump were to run again, it would be bad for the country.\nA storied, controversial career\nMurdochâs foray into the media business began in the 1950s with a small Australian newspaper chain,\nIn 1969, Murdoch landed his first major overseas prize with the purchase of the UKâs News of the World. He went on to acquire The Sun and The Times and The Sunday Times of London, building a newspaper empire that gave him unrivaled reach and political influence in Britain.\nIn 1973, Murdoch first entered the United States media sphere with the purchase of the San Antonio Express and the San Antonio News. A year later, he moved to New York and soon after began the National Star, a tabloid competing against the National Enquirer.\nPerhaps one of his most prolific purchases was the New York Post in 1976, a punchy New York City tabloid that still dominates the media and political sphere today. Heâs owned it since then, except for a brief time when rules prohibited ownership of newspapers and TV stations in the same city. He bought it back in 1993 after selling it in 1988.\nMurdoch became a major Hollywood executive in 1985 when he purchased Twentieth Century Fox from oilman Marvin Davis for $600 million. In 1986, Murdoch got into the television business after he purchased several US television stations and created Fox Broadcasting.\nHe launched UK satellite pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 1989, before merging it with a major rival just a year later after a bruising price war.\nBut his UK empire foundered two decades later as a consequence of a hacking scandal at the News of the World.\nMurdoch shut the Sunday tabloid â one of Britainâs oldest and best-selling newspapers â in July 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that the outlet had illegally eavesdropped on murder and terror victims, politicians and celebrities. The scandal forced him to abandon a bid to take control of Sky.\nHe made another bid for the pay-TV broadcaster in 2016, but it became ensnared by UK media regulators who worried that the deal would give the Murdoch family too much influence in Britain and concerns over its commitment to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Comcast swooped in at the last minute and outbid Fox for Sky.\nAlthough he focused largely on print and TV, he did unsuccessfully try to dominate the internet too. He bought MySpace, one of the first social networks, in 2005 for $580 million. in 2011, he sold it for a substantial loss at $35 million. He later reflected that its failure was because of a âseries of expensive lost opportunitiesâ with an addition of a âlayer of bureaucracyâ that halted progress against rivals like Facebook and YouTube.\nMurdoch sold much of his media empire, including the Twentieth Century Fox film studio, to Disney in a massive $71 billion deal in 2019. He was left with a much leaner broadcast portfolio, consisting of Fox News and Fox Sports.\nAfter that sale, however, he maintained his News Corp. newspaper business, including the Wall Street Journal, which was part of his companyâs Dow Jones purchase in 2007 for $5.6 billion. Under his purview, the broadsheet expanded its focus beyond money and markets, built a successful paywall and kept its down-the-middle tone except for its conservative Opinion page.\nFox News\nFox News launched in 1996 as a conservative startup competitor to CNN. It eventually became the top cable news channel in America by playing into conservative narratives.\nThe channel, however, veered from its roots in conservative news as former President Donald Trump ascended to power in the Republican Party in 2015, becoming an unabashed home of right-wing propaganda aimed at propping up the scandal-ridden White House.\nMurdoch-owned outlets also have a long history of undermining and down-playing climate science. In the US, Fox News has become a home to climate change conspiracy theories and the people who proliferate them. While Murdoch has said many times that he does not support climate denial, his outlets have continued to push climate doubt and platform climate skeptics.\nâNobody has done more harm to the understanding of climate change than Rupert Murdoch, who has wielded his global media network as a weapon to sow doubt and confusion about the basic science and the case for action,â Michael Mann, a renowned climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN.\nIn recent years, under Murdoch, Fox News has advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.\nThe lies Fox News pushed about the election spawned two massive defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\nFox earlier this year settled the Dominion lawsuit for a historic $787.5 million. The Smartmatic lawsuit, however, continues to make its way through the court system.\nFox News announced Murdochâs retirement on its air Thursday morning, with anchor Bill Hemmer praising the networkâs founder.\nâRupert Murdoch created all of this and so much more across America and the globe,â Hemmer said. âHis lifeâs work has left an indelible imprint on the global media landscape. His contributions are both innumerable and extraordinary and we thank him for letting us be a part of it all.â\nâWithout him, we would not be here,â anchor Dana Perino added.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "California releases its own plan for Colorado River cuts\nBy KATHLEEN RONAYNE and SUMAN NAISHADHAM\nAssociated Press\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California released a plan Tuesday detailing how Western states reliant on the Colorado River should save more water. It came a day after the six other states in the river basin made a competing proposal.\nIn a letter to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California described how states could conserve between 1 million and nearly 2 million acre feet of water through new cuts based on the elevation of Lake Mead, a key reservoir.\nIts plan did not account for water lost to evaporation and during transportation — a move sought by the other states that would mean big cuts for California.\nThe 1,450-mile river (2,334-kilometer) serves 40 million people across the West and Mexico, generating hydroelectric power for regional markets and irrigating nearly 6 million acres (2,428 hectares) of farmland.\nA multi-decade drought in the West worsened by climate change, rising demand and overuse has sent water levels at key reservoirs along the river to unprecedented lows. That has forced federal and state officials to take additional steps to protect the system.\nCalifornia’s plan and the separate methods outlined by states Monday came in response to Reclamation asking them last year to detail how they would use between 15% and 30% less water. The federal agency operates the major dams in the river system.\nAll seven states missed that deadline last August. Six of them regrouped and came to an agreement by the end of January. California was the the lone holdout to that agreement, and responded Tuesday with its own plan.\nUnlike the other states’ plan, California’s does not factor the roughly 1.5 million acre feet of Colorado River water lost to evaporation and transportation.\nInstead, it proposes reducing water taken out of Lake Mead by 1 million acre feet, with 400,000 acre feet coming from its own users. The state previously outlined that level of cuts in October. Arizona would bear the brunt of bigger cuts — 560,000 acre feet — while Nevada would make up the rest. Those numbers are based on discussions from prior negotiations, California’s letter said.\nAn acre foot is enough water to supply two to three U.S. households for a year.\nThe Arizona Department of Water Resources said it was still reviewing California’s proposal and didn’t have an immediate comment.\nBut Tom Buschatzke, the department’s director, said earlier Tuesday that water managers across the basin couldn’t reach agreement with California on cuts, even at the broader state level.\n“The big issues are what does the priority system mean, what does the junior priority mean and how does that attach to that outcome of who takes what cut?” he said. “That was the issue over the summer, that was the issue over the fall, that’s still the issue.”\nCalifornia has the largest allocation of water among the seven U.S. states that tap the Colorado River. It is also among the last to face water cuts in times of shortage because of its senior water rights.\nThat has given the state an advantage over others in talks that spanned months over how to cut water use.\nCalifornia water officials have often repeated that any additional water cuts must be legally defensible and in line with western water law that honors its water rights.\nJB Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California and a board member of the Imperial Irrigation District, indicated California may file a lawsuit if the federal government attempts to count for evaporative losses.\n“The best way to avoid conflict and ensure that we can put water in the river right away is through a voluntary approach, not putting proposals that sidestep the Law of the River and ignore California’s senior right and give no respect to that,” he said.\nExisting agreements only spell cuts when Lake Mead’s elevation is between 1,090 feet (332 meters) and 1,025 feet (312 meters). If it drops any lower than 1,025 feet, California’s plan proposes even further cuts based on the so-called Law of the River — likely meaning Arizona and Nevada would bear the brunt of them. Those cuts are designed to keep Lake Mead from reaching “dead pool,” when it could no longer pump out water to farms and cities including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix.\nThe reservoir’s current elevation is around 1,045 feet.\nIn total, California’s plan could save between 1 million and 2 million acre-feet of water based on the elevation levels at Lake Mead, from which Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico draw their share of the river.\nAdel Hagekhalil, general manager for the Metropolitan Water District of California, the nation’s largest water supplier, said it was important to protect key reservoirs “without getting mired in lengthy legal battles.”\nHagekhalil and other water managers pointed to numerous efforts the state has made to drastically reduce its water usage by making agricultural and urban water use more efficient.\n“California knows how to permanently reduce use of the river — we have done it over the past 20 years, through billions of dollars in investments and hard-earned partnerships,” he said in a statement. “We can help the entire Southwest do it again as we move forward.”\nThe new proposals do not change states’ water allocations immediately — or disrupt their existing water rights. Instead, they will be folded into a larger proposal Reclamation is working on to revise how it operates Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams — behemoth power producers on the Colorado River.\nDespite California’s inability to reach agreement with the other six states so far, the parties said they hope to keep talking.\n“We’re not going to stop the discussions,” said Buschatzke of Arizona, “and maybe we come to an agreement and maybe we won’t.”\n___\nNaishadham reported from Washington, D.C.

        "story_text": "Democracy on the agenda as Biden meets Brazil’s Lula at the White House\nBy Kevin Liptak, CNN\nWhen Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, met President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, the two hoped to reset relations after an era defined by right-wing populists and threats to democracy in both nations.\nThe talks, expected to center around efforts to combat climate change and tackle anti-democratic extremism, came roughly a month after protesters aligned with far-right former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed government institutions in Brasilia following Bolsonaro’s election loss.\n“Both of our nations’ strong democracies have been tested of late, very much tested, and our institutions put in jeopardy,” Biden told Lula in the Oval Office on Friday. “But in both the United States and Brazil, democracy prevailed.”\nThe event carried troubling echoes of the US insurrection attempt on January 6, 2021, not least because Bolsonaro was closely aligned with former US President Donald Trump. After his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States; he has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month.\n“To defend democracy is an obligation of all democrats in the world,” Lula told CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview in Washington. “I (could never) have imagined that it could happen in US, in North America, the invasion of the Capitol. As I never could imagine that in Brazil, after a democratic procession with elections, we could have an invasion of the Congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace.”\n“This means that you have an extreme right running around the world, an extreme right that is very nervous and that uses fake news as if it was a tool to develop politics and to talk to people, to communicate with people,” he went on. “And we have to destroy, you know, this narrative that they use against the democrats.”\nFor Biden, the episode was another sign that protecting democracy is a global imperative.\nBy extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hoped to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere’s key players.\nBiden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula’s officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties.\nBiden largely iced Bolsonaro out, engaging with him only sparingly. With the left-wing Lula, he finds more of an ideological ally.\nThey have met previously; when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro.\nRebuilding those bonds, and affirming a commitment to democracy, was key in their first face-to-face meeting.\n“I affirm the United States’ unwavering support for Brazil’s democracy, and respect for the free will of the Brazilian people,” Biden said Friday. “We reject political violence.”\nHanging over the meeting was Bolsonaro’s continued presence in the United States. Bolsonaro is seeking a six-month tourist visa to remain in the US, the law firm representing Bolsonaro confirmed to CNN Brasil on January 30. The US State Department has refused to confirm Bolsonaro’s visa status due to confidentiality.\nBolsonaro has been in Florida since December 30, leaving Brazil days before the January 1 inauguration of his successor. His presence in Florida has drawn criticism by House Democrats, who in mid-January urged Biden not to “provide shelter” for Bolsonaro in the wake of his supporters storming Brazil’s democratic institutions in the capital Brasília.\nLula told Amanpour there was “no chance for (Bolsonaro) to come back to the presidency of the republic.”\nAhead of Friday’s visit, a US official said Biden was prepared to discuss “any issue” that Lula wanted, but suggested they did not expect Bolsonaro’s status in the United States to arise. The official said they were unaware of any formal extradition requests related to Bolsonaro.\n“If and when we receive one, I know we will give it the deserving response,” the official said.\nInstead, officials described an agenda focused mainly on areas of agreement, though on Ukraine there could be some dissension.\nAtop the agenda was climate change, which has already been the primary focus of their two phone calls. When he was in office, Bolsonaro sped up deforestation of the Amazon. Lula has vowed to protect the forest and advance efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\nThey were also expected to discuss ways to bolster democracy and efforts inside both countries to advance human rights, social inclusion, gender equality and safeguarding LGBTQ rights, a senior US administration official said.\nOther topics on the agenda included economic matters and an early conversation about Brazil’s 2024 presidency of the G20.\nAn area they may not be as closely aligned is on Ukraine. Lula has adopted a policy of non-intervention, rebuffing efforts led by Biden to united the global community in opposition to Russia’s invasion.\nLula was expected to propose a “peace club” meant to negotiate an end to the war, including countries like China and India that haven’t taken as firm a stance in opposition to the invasion.\nBiden is “looking forward” to hearing out Lula’s proposals for Ukraine, the senior administration official said, and the US will “respect and support efforts by Lula to promote dialogue and peace.” Biden welcomes Lula’s readiness to to reengage on the global stage, the official said.\nStill, the official acknowledged Biden and Lula “may not always agree on everything” but have a shared interest in ensuring peace.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Outgoing president of Micronesia accuses China of bribery, threats and ‘political warfare’\nBy Angus Watson and Nectar Gan, CNN\nThe outgoing president of Micronesia has accused China of engaging in “political warfare” in the Pacific, in an explosive letter advocating for the the dissolution of diplomatic ties with Beijing.\nIn the 13-page letter, which CNN has obtained, David Panuelo alleges China is preparing to invade the self-ruled island of Taiwan, and has engaged in bribery, political interference and even “direct threats” to ensure the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) remains neutral in the event of war.\nChina dismissed the letter’s contents as “smears and accusations.”\n“I would like to emphasize that China has always upheld the equality of all countries — no matter their size — and has always respected how Micronesia chooses its own development, based on its own circumstances,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Friday in a regular press briefing.\nPanuelo, who has previously been critical of Beijing’s actions in the Pacific region, revealed he had considered switching diplomatic recognition to Taipei.\n“China is seeking to ensure that, in the event of a war in our Blue Pacific continent between themselves and Taiwan, that the FSM is, at best, aligned with the PRC (China) instead of the United States, and, at worst, that the FSM chooses to ‘abstain’ altogether,” he wrote.\nThe Chinese Communist Party claims the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan as its own territory — despite having never governed it — and has refused to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.\nPanuelo also accused China of “political warfare” in his country, which he claimed included overt activities — such as political alliances, economic measures and public propaganda — and clandestine acts such as “bribery, psychological warfare, and blackmail”.\n“One of the reasons that China’s political warfare is successful in so many arenas is that we are bribed to be complicit, and bribed to be silent. That’s a heavy word, but it is an accurate description regardless,” he wrote in the letter.\nCNN has reached out to Panuelo an Taiwan’s foreign ministry for comment.\nPanuelo, whose term in office is set to expire in two months after losing his seat in the recent general election, has been president of Micronesia since 2019.\nHe has previously spoken out on China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, including warning against Beijing’s proposal of a sweeping regional security deal with 10 Pacific Island nations.\nLast May, in a separate letter to 22 Pacific leaders seen by CNN, Panuelo said the draft proposal was intended to shift Pacific Island nations with diplomatic ties to China “very close into Beijing’s orbit.”\nHe argued that in addition to impacting the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations, signing such an agreement could bring about a new “Cold War” amid tensions between China and the West.\nChina ultimately failed in its bid to strike the security pact with Pacific Island nations.\nThe release of Panuelo’s latest — and most explosive — letter comes amid heightened concern from regional powers over Beijing’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe Pacific Islands’ location, largely to the northeast of Australia, means the island nations have long been viewed by military strategists as a vital connecting thread between the US territory of Guam and US-allied Australia.\nBoth the US and Australia are wary of a China that has grown increasingly assertive in the South China Sea extending its reach further west into Pacific waters, including toward the FSM, an archipelago of more than 600 islands.\nMeanwhile, the island nations themselves — typically more concerned about the ravages of climate change than geopolitics — have been wary of being viewed as pawns in a great power struggle.\nChina’s interest in building rapport with the Pacific Islands countries is not new.\nIn the early 2000s, as the US was turning its attention toward perceived threats in the Middle East, a newly outward-looking China was starting on a path to become an economic and diplomatic partner for Pacific island countries.\nA focal point of Beijing’s outreach was to win friends away from Taiwan, which is now only formally recognized by four of 14 South Pacific nations, after the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched allegiance to China in 2019.\nIn recent years, as Beijing has pursued a more assertive foreign policy and expanded development funding globally in a bid to enhance its international sway, its visibility in the Pacific Islands, too, has grown.\nChina has backed widely publicized projects in some Pacific Island countries — a national sports stadium to host the Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands, highways in Papua New Guinea, bridges in Fiji — and sent high-level envoys to the region, including two visits from Chinese leader Xi Jinping, once in 2014 and again in 2018.\nIt’s also become a major trading partner for Pacific Island economies.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Who is Michael Regan, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency?\nBy Shawna Mizelle, CNN\nThe derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, has brought fresh attention to the US Environmental Protection Agency and its leader, Michael Regan.\nRegan has traveled back and forth to East Palestine in recent weeks, meeting with residents and local and state officials, as federal efforts ramp up to address the wreck that unleashed plumes of black smoke and contaminated the soil at the crash site and some waterways.\nOn Tuesday, Regan visited an East Palestine home and drank tap water with Gov. Mike DeWine — trying to reinforce earlier assurances that the municipal water supply is safe. Shortly after, the EPA ordered Norfolk Southern, the company who operated the train carrying hazardous materials, to handle and pay for all necessary cleanup.\n“The Norfolk Southern train derailment has upended the lives of East Palestine families, and EPA’s order will ensure the company is held accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of this community,” Regan said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe Senate confirmed Regan as EPA administrator with a bipartisan vote in March 2021, making him the first Black man to lead the agency in its 50-year history. His historic confirmation followed that of Lisa Jackson, who during the Obama administration became the first African American to head the agency.\nA Goldsboro, North Carolina, native and graduate of North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, Regan holds an undergraduate degree in environmental science and a master’s degree in public administration from The George Washington University, according to his EPA biography.\nHe met his wife, Melvina, at A&T, according to a university news release, and the couple shares one son, Matthew.\nRegan has said attending the historically Black college in his undergraduate years prepared him for his administrator role. “It strengthened my understanding of who I am and what I can do for society,” he said in the release.\nAfter college, Regan began a post-graduate internship at the EPA where he established his career for a decade serving during the Bush and Clinton administrations, eventually becoming a national program manager. According to the EPA, he worked in that capacity on designing pathways to “reduce air pollution, improve energy efficiency and address climate change.”\nHe reflected on his career during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n“I knew I wanted to find a way to serve, and that led to my first summer internship at EPA. I spent nearly ten years at EPA under presidents of both parties,” Regan told the Senate panel, adding: “It’s an honor of a lifetime to be invited back.”\nRegan has been one of the climate-focused members of President Joe Biden’s administration, playing a central part in the president’s efforts to end carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and investments in clean energy projects.\nUnder his leadership, the EPA in September created the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, a new national office.\nRegan previously served as the secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality after being tapped for the position by North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in 2017.\nHe also served as the associate vice president of US Climate and Energy and Southeast regional director at the Environmental Defense Fund, according to the EPA.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "The Federal Reserve is testing how climate change could hurt big banks\nBy Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nThe largest six banks in the United States have been given until July to show the Federal Reserve what effects disastrous climate change scenarios could have on their bottom lines.\nNoting the risks could be “material,” the Fed said the banks will have to show how their finances fare under a number of climate stress tests, including heat waves, wildfires, floods and droughts, according to details of a new Fed pilot program released on Tuesday.\n“The pilot exercise includes physical risk scenarios with different levels of severity affecting residential and commercial real estate portfolios in the Northeastern United States and directs each bank to consider the impact of additional physical risk shocks for their real estate portfolios in another region of the country,” wrote the Fed.\nThe Federal Reserve first announced the pilot program in September, noting that Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo would participate.\nClimate activists said that the project was long overdue (Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been questioned about it multiple times over the last year), and that other central banks are far ahead of the Fed on climate risk assessments. The Bank of England ran a similar exercise in 2021.\nThey also said the proposal lacked any real teeth. In its announcement the Federal Reserve stressed that the exercise “is exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences.” It also said that it would not publish individual banks’ results.\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly told CNN in October that this was a learning and exploratory exercise for the Federal Reserve. It would be “incredibly premature to jump to the conclusion that any new policies or programs would come out of it,” she said.\nThe other side: Critics of the pilot program have argued that the Federal Reserve was overstepping its boundaries and that they might soon begin to enforce financial penalties.\n“The Fed’s new ‘pilot’ program is the first step toward pressuring banks into limiting loans to and investments in traditional energy companies and other disfavored carbon-emitting sectors,” wrote former Republican Senator Pat Toomey, then a ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. “The real purpose of this program is to ultimately produce new regulatory requirements.”\nPowell said last week that the central bank would not become a “climate policymaker.”\n“Today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision the perceived risks associated with climate change is appropriate, wise, and consistent with our existing mandates,” Powell said last Tuesday. “In my view, the Fed does have narrow, but important, responsibilities regarding climate-related financial risks. These responsibilities are tightly linked to our responsibilities for bank supervision. The public reasonably expects supervisors to require that banks understand, and appropriately manage, their material risks, including the financial risks of climate change.”\nChips are the new oil\nThe discovery, movement and use of oil has played an outsized role in shaping geopolitics over the past century and a half. But over the next 50 years, global interaction and wealth are more likely to be influenced by microchips, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNN Tuesday.\n“Where the technology supply chains are, and where semiconductors are built, is more important for the next five decades,” Gelsinger said in an interview with CNN’s Julia Chatterley at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nIntel (INTC) is betting those predictions prove true. The company announced in 2021 it would invest $20 billion to build two new US chipmaking facilities, as well as up to $90 billion in new European factories, aimed at reasserting its position as the leader of the semiconductor industry, reports my colleague Clare Duffy.\nGelsinger said the company’s investment in new manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere is important not only for the company’s future, but for the “globalization of the most critical resource to the future of the world.”\n“We need this geographically balanced, resilient supply chain,” he said.\nThe announcements also came amid concerns about the concentration of manufacturing for chips, in Asia, particularly China and Taiwan, during the Covid-19 pandemic and as geopolitical tensions grew. Issues in the chip supply chain in recent years have caused shortages and shipping delays of everything from desktop computers and iPhones to cars.\n“If we’ve learned one thing from the Covid crisis and this multi-year journey that we’ve been on it’s we need resilience in our supply chains,” Gelsinger said, adding that Intel’s manufacturing investments are aimed at “leveling that playing field so that good investment decisions can be made.”\nThe top 1% are getting richer far faster than everyone else\nThe years following the peak of the Covid pandemic have not been good for wealth equality.\nThe world’s wealthiest residents have been getting far richer, far faster than everyone else over the past two years, reports my colleague Tami Luhby.\nThe fortune of the 1% soared by $26 trillion during that period, while the bottom 99% only saw their net worth rise by $16 trillion, according to Oxfam’s annual inequality report released Sunday.\nAnd the wealth accumulation of the super-rich accelerated during the pandemic. Looking over the past decade, they netted just half of all the new wealth created, compared to two-thirds during the last few years.\nMeanwhile, many of the less fortunate are struggling. Some 1.7 billion workers live in countries where inflation is outpacing wages. And poverty reduction likely stalled last year after the number of global poor skyrocketed in 2020.\n“While ordinary people are making daily sacrifices on essentials like food, the super-rich have outdone even their wildest dreams,” said Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International.\n“Just two years in, this decade is shaping up to be the best yet for billionaires — a roaring ’20s boom for the world’s richest,” she said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "story_text": "Threat of rising seas to Asian megacities could be way worse than we thought, study warns\nBy Tara Subramaniam, CNN\nParts of Asia’s largest cities could be under water by 2100 thanks to rising sea levels, according to a new study that combines both the impact of climate change with natural oceanic fluctuations.\nSea levels have already been on the rise due to increasing ocean temperatures and unprecedented levels of ice melting caused by climate change.\nBut a report published in the journal Nature Climate Change offers fresh insight and stark warnings about how bad the impact could be for millions of people.\nWhile many shoreline Asian megacities were already at risk of flooding, the study suggests that previous analysis underestimated the degree of sea level rise and subsequent flooding caused by natural ocean fluctuations.\nSince natural fluctuations have a high degree of variability, their impact is hard to quantify. But the study showed that with the maximum possible impact from natural fluctuations combined with the expected consequences of climate change, several Southeast Asian megacities would become new hotspots of high sea-level rise.\nIn the Philippine capital Manila, for example, the study predicts that coastal flooding events within the next century will occur 18 times more often than before, solely because of climate change.\nBut factoring in naturally-occurring fluctuations in sea level increases the frequency of coastal flooding up to 96 times more often than before, the study found.\nMillions should ‘prepare for the worst’\nLourdes Tibig, a climate science adviser for the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities in the Philippines, said the study’s findings underscore the urgency of addressing climate change.\n“The world needs to act on climate change with far more urgency and ambition to protect the millions living in our coastal megacities,” Tibig said.\nManila, where more than 13 million people live, is far from alone.\nThe study, conducted by scientists at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the University of La Rochelle in France and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States (NCAR), found that Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and Yangon, Myanmar are particularly at risk, along with Chennai and Kolkata in India, some western tropical Pacific islands and the western Indian Ocean.\nThe rise in sea level along the west coasts of the United States and Australia would also increase, the study suggested.\nAcross the Asian megacities alone, more than 50 million people could be affected by the higher than expected rise in sea levels — nearly 30 million of them in India.\nBangkok is home to at least 11 million people, Ho Chi Minh City more than 9 million and Yangon around 5.6 million.\nThe sea level changes detailed in the report are not likely to take effect until the end of the 21st century. However, if the pace of greenhouse gas emissions increases, the threat becomes more imminent, the authors warned.\nNCAR scientist Aixue Hu, one of the study’s authors, said policy makers and the general public alike should be concerned about these potential threats.\n“From a policy perspective, we have to prepare for the worst,” Hu said.\nWarming waters\nAccording to a NCAR news release, the study found that naturally occurring events such as El Niño, a weather phenomenon known to leave much of the West Pacific, Australia and Asia warmer than usual, could amplify the anticipated sea level rise due to climate change by 20-30%, which also increases the risk of extreme flooding events.\nClimate change has already triggered unprecedented extreme flooding in the Asia-Pacific region within the last year.\nAn analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service described 2022 as “a year of climate extremes,” including deadly floods in Pakistan and widespread flooding in Australia.\nAt the same time, ocean temperatures are the highest they’ve ever been and expected to continue increasing.\nA January report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted that ocean temperatures were at a record high last year, surpassing the previous record set in 2021.\nThe past four years have been the warmest four on record for the planet’s oceans.\n“And unfortunately, we’re predicting that 2023 will actually be warmer than 2022,” Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA, said in January.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
