        "text": "A new poll shows the majority of Washington voters want legislators to invest this year in social services such as mental health, schools, reducing homelessness and combating climate change. They also want some taxes repealed.\nThis year's legislative session kicks off Monday in Olympia, and legislators are working with an unexpected $1 billion in extra revenue from the state's new capital gains tax and carbon auction program.\nThe 2024 edition of the annual Crosscut/Elway legislative preview poll was released Thursday. In it, 84% of voters indicated they want the government to fund behavioral health programs and combat the statewide opioid epidemic.\nThe poll also found about 57% of voters simultaneously favored repealing the state's new capital gains tax. A voter initiative proposing that repeal is poised to land on the November ballot.\nEvery year, pollsters with Elway Research Inc. ask registered voters in Washington to list their top legislative priorities ahead of the state's legislative session. A total of 403 registered voters from across Washington were selected at random for this year's poll and responded to questions via telephone.\nPollster Stuart Elway presented his findings at an event in Olympia Thursday. Elway has been conducting polls since the early 1980s, and he said one sentiment has always rung true for the majority of voters:\n\"More people have been optimistic about their own household than for the country,\" Elway said. \"This is a typical pattern. Things are going well at my house, but the country is going (poorly).\"\nThe top issue voters want state lawmakers to focus on for the third straight year is the economy, according to the poll. Some type of economic issue was the top concern of 32% of voters. Specifically, cost of living and inflation were the most chosen issues. The issues of public safety and homelessness tied for the next most popular, followed by taxes, government, education and the environment.\nFor voters, police pursuits were another high-priority issue. About 66% of poll respondents reported they want to eliminate some restrictions on when police can pursue criminal suspects in cars.\nLast year, the Legislature passed a bill that limited law enforcement's ability to chase most nonviolent alleged offenders. The bill has received pushback from much of the law enforcement community, along with some lawmakers who argue the new law prevents cops from doing their jobs effectively. Those who support the law argue it increases safety — for police and civilians alike — due to the inherently dangerous nature of high-speed car chases.\nThe Legislature convenes for its first day Monday. The session is scheduled to last 60 days.",

        "text": 'Warmer and wetter winter in Raleigh area has climate change footprint, according to scientists\nThe Raleigh area was much warmer and wetter than normal in December, according to a new analysis by Climate Central.\nThis year stood out as the second wettest December in Raleigh from data going back to 1887.\nRaleigh and Durham saw 7.01 inches of precipitation, which was 207% more rain than the normal amount, according to data from regional branches of NOAA and normal is defined relative to the past 30-year average.\nClimate change can correlate with rainfall because warmer air can hold more water. The basic idea is that for every 1°F increase in temperature, the atmosphere can hold 4% more water vapor.\n"It can increase the potential for big rain events," said Andrew Pershing, VP for Science at Climate Central, a Princeton-based climate science non-profit.\nThat is consistent with North Carolina\'s December storms, that each brought more than a normal month\'s worth of rain.\nLast month was also about 4.2% hotter than normal in Raleigh, with an average temperature of about 49 degrees.\nThat’s part of a wider winter warming trend, with Raleigh and Durham seeing 16 more warm winter days than they did in 1970.\n"We have a lot of plants that require a certain number of hours of freezing temperatures and, if they\'re not getting those, they\'re not going to produce the fruit and flowers that we expect in the spring," Pershing said. "And it can really mess with some of the migratory patterns."\nIn addition to warm temps impacting the ecosystem and biodiversity, it can have an impact on recreation and tourism too.\nMany North Carolina ski mountains including Beech, App and Sugar opened weeks later than the planned opening days.\nNASA scientists say 2023 was the hottest on record.\n"Which means it was the warmest year in 125,000 years," Pershing said. "This is not normal, this is not something that would happen without humans putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and we know that 2024 is very, very likely to be even warmer."',

        "text": "Meteorologist Mike Wankum discusses snowstorm headed for Mass., New England\nMeteorologist Mike Wankum discusses snowstorm headed for Mass., New England\nLet's start off with. Ok. The one thing that everybody wants to know how much snow is going to fall out of this thing here is our early estimates of what's gonna happen. And I feel pretty comfortable with these. I'm gonna show you some computer models in *** few moments and you'll be able to see why. I'm kind of believing that these numbers are looking pretty good. Uh Obviously more snow inland, lesser amounts at the coast because we get the mixing going on. This is what I call *** classic New England snowstorm because this is what happens so many times. If you're down to the south shore, the cape of the islands, you're going, uh what snow? Meanwhile, Worcester is digging out from *** foot of snow. So there's *** big spread many times between. It has *** lot to do with our elevation. So here's the storm coming in and as I mentioned, nothing really going on until Saturday night. So this is the map at Saturday night at 10 o'clock. Now, there may be some stray snow showers ahead of it. There's be *** lot of gray skies out there on Saturday afternoon, but Saturday morning may actually start with *** little hint of sunshine and then it really starts to move in here and you can see what happens. Now, look carefully and you see that, that magenta color right there. That's the mix and it's right there at the coast down through the Cape as the system goes by, it will then pull into some colder air and it'll drive the snow down toward the Cape, which means at the cape, you may not get your snow until probably after everyone else is talking about. Well, the snow is really piling up here. Uh, by about 23 o'clock, you should be changing over and you know, there's gonna be *** lot of rain with this thing and I'll show you in *** moment that we're looking at maybe an inch to an inch and *** half of, of liquid content. That's *** lot of water. And what happens is when the storm starts to pull that cold air in, we're gonna start to freeze some things up, not *** flash freeze. I'm not worried about that, but it will be cold enough that there may be some ice in areas that really had rain for most of this entire event. So then the whole thing pulls out of here by midnight, it's pretty much gone and we're pretty much done with it. And this is why we're kind of talking about this storm more than we normally would. I mean, it's not *** huge, it's *** good sized one, but it's not huge. But the reason is we haven't gotten any snow. I mean, Boston, we picked up two tents. That was that first week in December, you know, down towards Rockland there was about three inches of snow that fell out of that one. Worcester picking up some snow. Most of Worcester was actually in November. Uh, so we're running *** good foot to *** foot and *** half below where we're supposed to be this time of year. And we didn't really have much of *** winter last year. So the national, the service issued *** winter storm watch this afternoon, but it does not go into effect until Saturday at four o'clock and then it goes until late Sunday night. Now, at four o'clock, it's not gonna get all started, but that just gives you *** little heads up that, that's gonna be going on as we head towards Saturday evening. Now, the area that is not in this watch is down to the south. That's because we're going to deal with some mix in the Brockton and New Bedford area. You get on the other side of the canal, we're gonna deal with rain. Eventually, it will change over to all snow and we will get *** little accumulation out of it, but it's really the inland areas they're gonna be seeing most of snow from this one. And the thing we need is cold air. We have had so many storms this winter where we got tons and tons of rain. Remember, we've got, we've got places that have got three and four inches of rain out of the whole thing. Imagine that with some cold weather, we're talking about 34 feet of snow, we've had plenty of moisture. We just haven't had the cold. So this time around we are gonna get some cold coming in here and it's coming in tonight. So *** heads up, your Friday is gonna be cold and windy, cold air is in place. Now, we just wait for the storm to catch up with us and that's gonna eventually get in here. So that's what we'll be watching as we go forward into the storm. So that's the cold air and you can see where it's coming from. Look at Canada never been to moan, but it's only five right now. Churchill 17 below. And some of these towns I can't even pronounce because they got so many vowels in them, but it is cold up there and we're just gonna tap into that and the tapped in cold air will be with us on Friday, Saturday and on Sunday. And that's why we're talking about snow instead of rain like we have done so many times before. So we, we've made this an impact, weather day, impact weather means that, hey, there's something you really need to pay attention to. Sometimes we'll do *** nuisance where we put *** yellow light up and that just means kind of like, oh, it's gonna be an inconvenience it. We put the red up. It's like, uh, you need to pay attention to this one because there's gonna be *** lot of things going on. And of course, the one thing that's really gonna be going on with this storm is the fact that it's snow and slick roads and we have not been on slick roads for *** while. We didn't get much winter, much of *** winter last year, rain and mix near the coast. But as I pointed out at the end of the storm, it gets cold. Gotta watch out there could be some icy spots with it and then gusts of 40 to 50 miles an hour at the coast, especially, especially as you look down toward the cape. You know, one thing II, I talk about driving in the snow. I did *** story *** few weeks ago about, uh, electric vehicles and there is something you need to do. If you have an electric vehicle, there's *** snow button on there. And the reason you push that snow button is because the car has what's called regenerative braking. In other words, as the car slows down, it sort of grabs and regenerates electricity and feeds it back into the batteries. It's *** great system that works. However, in the winter when it's icy, that regenerative braking could actually put you into *** slide more than you wanted to. So that's why they put that snow button on there. So push the snow button if you have electric vehicle and be prepared for that, that's the reason they put that there is because of that regenerative braking goes on. It's *** really interesting story. I was with Lars Anderson, uh, Auto Museum. Give you *** chance to stop over. It's *** great place to hang out and see some really amazing vehicles and they were very, very helpful with that story. All right, snowfall totals. Um, this is what we're looking at as I mentioned, lesser amount toward the Cape more as you look inland and especially as you get to the Worcester Hills and some elevation 9 to 12 inches. Now, I don't think everybody west of Worcester is gonna get 12 inches of snow. But if you get elevation, say 1500 ft above, you know, the places they're gonna pick up *** lot more snow than it is if you're down in the valley just *** little bit. So that's the general trend that we're looking at for snowfall. And people wonder, ok, what kind of snow am I gonna shovel inland? It's fluffier because it's colder. So that's why the snow will pile up more. You get closer to the coast, it gets wetter. And by the time you get down towards the south shore of the Cape, it's basically ***, *** 7-Eleven Slurpee. You know, I mean, the snow blowers don't even move it very well. So you may end up having to dig out the shovel. Uh Many people are, we had *** great story on last night from uh John Wa and he was putting together *** story about what you need to do to your snow blower if you haven't used it in *** couple of years, which is what *** lot of people are having to do deal with because they have not used it for *** while. So it was an interesting story. I hope you had *** chance to do it. If not, you can check it out on our website, we still have it up there. I'm sure. So. All right, that's what we're dealing. Now. I have been dealing with the, uh, you know, with the, with the computer models all week. Um, and *** lot of people like these things and you see them all over the web, everybody's got them, social media is full of, you know, the European model, the US model all of these things. And so I, I try to give you some insight as to what these models are saying and how they behave and, and, and how they play to our forecast and how we use them as meteorologists. They're guidance, they're not really forecast, we call them guidance because it's kind of the raw numbers being kicked out by the computer and it gives us an idea of what is happening and then I watch for trends, you know, is it being consistent model run after model run after model run or is it consistent with other models so that everybody's kind of in agreement? So this is the latest model run that we had come in just this afternoon. And you'll see there is *** great deal of consistency between these, the European, which is usually my favorite one was *** little bit kind of flopping all over the place initially on this one. And the GFS US model has kind of brought up its totals *** little bit and then brack them off *** little bit. So you see the trend here, it's gonna be, you know, lesser amounts of snow down toward the cape, more snow inland. Uh, they have backed off *** little bit, but I think that the issue that these two models have had for this entire event going into it, they really had *** difficult time realizing that the ocean is as warm as it is. It's on fire. I mean, you know, we talk about climate change and we've talked about it *** bunch here on, uh, New Center Five. But the thing about it is is that with climate change and that ocean being so warm, that warm air coming in is the reason we're gonna see some mixing and the computer model is having *** little difficult time with it. And so that's why you'll see. I have quite *** range in, in snowfall totals. Now, if the wind changes direction or the storm tracks *** little bit different, that's gonna be *** big hindrance. Remember this far out if we get the storm to track within 100 and 50 miles of where we think it is, that's pretty much considered *** success. So, *** little jog this way, *** little jog that way and it can change it dramatically as to what's gonna happen with the storm. So that is one thing, I'll be really, really watching as the storm goes through what the track is. I mean, if it cuts over the cape, well, *** lot of us will have rain. If it goes offshore, that's where we get all the snow and then somewhere between it when we get all that mix coming through here. So the liquid content, which I think is fascinating. You look at how much moisture is available for this storm. It's an inch to an inch and *** half. So that means if this was just pure cold and we had all this moisture coming in, we'd be talking about *** good foot and *** half of snow out of the whole thing. But because we're doing so much mixing going on with it, that's gonna hold the totals down and you can see where the heaviest rain is going to be, or liquid content is gonna be down toward the cape. But there again, you're gonna be able to do dealing with more mixing than you are, say west of Worcester out towards orange. So in orange, we're to squeeze all the moisture out and make it into snow. But maybe towards uh towards Hyannis, it's gonna be taking *** little bit more time before we can get the snow down there. And so *** lot of it's gonna be falling as rain. But let me give you an hour by hour breakdown of what's gonna happen. This is Saturday night, at nine o'clock, you have plans on Saturday, you're fine morning. You might even see *** little sunshine afternoon. You get some clouds, sun goes down. Ok? Now we're gonna pay attention because this is the snow moving in. And again, remember we're talking about this on Thursday night and this isn't even gonna happen until late Saturday night. So *** lot of things can change. So that's why I say stay on top of the forecast. And if I can for just *** moment, tell you about apps, you know, you get an app on your phone, you probably have *** weather app you're looking at it, puts *** big snowflake up there, but it doesn't tell you the time, it doesn't tell you the intensity, it doesn't tell you what all the variables are. And so that's why I say the app is good, but you really need to go ahead and go to *** couple of the sources and find out what's going on. And for those of you who watch us on channel five. We're very happy storm team has got *** great group of people and uh we've been able to put some forecasts together. I think they've been very, very good. We've had some great uh predecessors, you know, we had Dick Albert Harvey Leonard. Uh We've, we've, we've really tapped into that vast amount of knowledge that they've given us over the years and it's really just something you cannot get from just going to school and learning about weather. I mean, you'd be around somebody like that for *** while and, and you just can't help but absorb stuff that's going on. But anyhow, back to what this timeline in the snow is coming through. So here it is nine o'clock at night, you know, at the coast, it's still marginal. I don't even know if you'd hold snow under those temperatures. And then we kind of push the snow in here after midnight is when the steadiest comes in. The darker blue colors that you see down there by Bridgeport, that's the heavy snow, that's the intense stuff, the pink magenta color that you see. That's the mix. And then of course, the green is right. So as we go deeper into the night and closer to tomorrow morning or excuse me, Sunday morning, we go towards Sunday morning, you'll see that how we get that mix going on through the south shore of the Cape and the islands inland. The snow is getting very intense at this point. Look at orange at 29 you really have no chance of getting any rain out of this thing. It's gonna be all snow, but you get to Boston southward, 35. Uh, you can get snow, but more likely it's gonna be mixing at that point and then as the day goes on late morning, so that cold air is being drawn down through Plymouth. That's why it will change over to snow. If you're Hyannis still 40 degrees, it's just gonna be kind of *** mix in the air and *** lot of it melting on contact. But then as we get into the afternoon, see how the cold air kind of sinks farther and farther south. And that tells us that, oh, we're gonna start to change some of that one mix over to some snow and that's when you may get your accumulation, you may not get it over the cape until very late into the storm now because it's coming in so late, we're running out of moisture. So by eight o'clock we're down to kind of *** light snow, but it's light snow everywhere. This is where I'd be concerned about ice from Plymouth southward because now we have the cold air coming in. You can get some roads icy and of course it's been raining all day. So the crews haven't put much for chemicals and salt out, so they got it. They're *** little bit behind at that point. So you got to give them *** little time to get that stuff out there. I would say Sunday, you know, just kind of plan on staying home. You know, it just really no reason to go out in this stuff. But of course you got *** good sled then I would take it out. Uh, but anyhow, we head for Sunday, about 11 o'clock. This thing is all over with, but here comes the cold weather and it is going to be *** cold start to the week as we start things off. It looks like probably wind chills again, back down to the single digits on Monday morning. So *** chilly chilly start to your Monday morning out there. So snow forecast, as I said, heavier amounts out toward the west, 9 to 12 inches of snow seems very likely at this point, but not everyone's gonna see 12 inches, but you get about 1500 ft. I think there'll be *** foot out there in some places and there's always one or two spots that overachieves and gets even more than that. Then you head down toward the Cape. You won't get that till late the storm. I would say for Boston right now, if you look at it, I would say, you know, kind of at like Logan airport, Winthrop, you're probably in that 1 to 3 category, but then you get kind of downtown out to 128 kind of that 3 to 6 category and everybody always looks at the high number, look at the low number sometimes because that may be *** little closer to what's going on with the storm. And then once you get to do item 128 after 4 95 69 category seems like. And then once you get to four five, we're gonna be seeing more out there. It's interesting. You know, people ask me, why do you use those roads and why are, why are the roads kind of like the delineation for where the snow falls? Because 128 is built on the first elevation rise, 495 is built along the next elevation rise. So as you go from the coast to 128 to 495 that elevation really plays into *** forecast. Uh We're so grateful that the engineers 100 years ago decided to build those roads so we could use that for forecasting in that way. But I'm just kidding. Uh But, but that's the reason we use those and they work out really well. It's because of the ch the elevation changes that take place there. So that, that helps you with snowfall totals. That's why I was saying, you know, if you're about 1500 ft, you're probably gonna see more snow than somebody is in the valley. Uh Same thing out towards Cape Ann Gloucester, Rockport, you're probably that 1 to 3 category, but over towards north reading maybe 3 to 6, get over to Lowell, 6 to 9. And then, you know, once you get past rotten, you're talking about even more snow out there down to the cape, as I say, it's, you know, *** lot of rain, there's plenty of moisture. But, uh, I don't know, the cold is gonna get there until late in the storm. So that's why I'm saying about 1 to 3 and nuck, you're pretty much stuck in the rain all the way through the ocean surrounding. It is about 45 degrees at this point down around Nantucket and then west of Worcester, 6 to 12 inches of snow. You know, the usual spots. I mean, you get up there towards Leominster Fitchburg and orange on route two. Those are the areas that are most likely to get *** foot of snow and then lesser amounts is looked down toward the valleys and in Worcester, of course, you have so many hills and stuff. You can get high totals in one part of town and low totals in the other part of town just because of the up and downs that are going through there. So that's how much snow we're thinking about as it comes on through. Uh, again, not *** block buster storm, but probably one of the heavier snows we've seen heavier than we saw last year in most cases. And some places, this is the heaviest snow you've seen in two years. Wow, climate change is really impacting our snow around the area, isn't it? That's *** topic for another day. All right, the winds, they're going to really ramp up out of this thing and they're gonna be coming out of the northeast. Um, typically, you know, you get worried about northeaster with the tides and things like that. I'm not overly concerned just because the time this is coming in and when those winds really ramp up, but over the cape 4050 mile an hour wind gusts seem very, very likely. Um, interesting today. Um And we, we're on actually on an anniversary, I'll talk about that in *** second. But let me talk about *** little bit about what's gonna happen Sunday morning. That's our highest high tide. It's at 719. But you see, things haven't really ramped up at that point. And by the time we get the Sunday evening, high tide, the wind is switch direction kind to the northwest. So really the biggest surge that's gonna happen for the storm is gonna happen probably around lunchtime on Sunday. So, unless the storm slows down or speeds up, it's not coming in at the right time to really get *** lot of flooding going on, which I think is really welcome.\nAdvertisement\nMeteorologist Mike Wankum discusses snowstorm headed for Mass., New England\nStormTeam 5 meteorologist Mike Wankum has an extended look at the snowstorm set to hit Massachusetts this weekend, when the heaviest snow could fall, and which parts of New England will see the heaviest snow.\nStormTeam 5 meteorologist Mike Wankum has an extended look at the snowstorm set to hit Massachusetts this weekend, when the heaviest snow could fall, and which parts of New England will see the heaviest snow.\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Azerbaijan's ecology minister has been named to lead the United Nations' annual climate talks later this year, prompting concern from some climate activists over his former ties to the state oil company in a major oil-producing nation.\nMukhtar Babayev's appointment was announced on X by the United Arab Emirates, which hosted the climate talks that just ended in December, and confirmed Friday by the United Nations. Officials in Azerbaijan did not immediately respond to messages seeking to confirm the appointment.\nBabayev, 56, has been his country's minister for ecology and natural resources since 2018. Before that, he worked at Azerbaijan's state oil company for more than two decades.\nSimilar concerns dogged Sultan al-Jaber, the head of the UAE's national oil company, as he presided over the talks in Dubai known as COP28. The COP president is responsible for running talks and getting nearly 200 countries to agree on a deal to help limit global warming, and skeptics questioned whether al-Jaber would be willing to confront the fossil fuels causing climate change.\nThe conference ultimately resulted in a final agreement that for the first time mentioned fossil fuels as the cause of climate change and acknowledged the need to transition away from them, but it had no concrete requirements to do so.\nOil and natural gas bring in around 90% of Azerbaijan’s export revenues and finance around 60% of the government budget, according to the International Energy Agency. Climate activists said the country needs to look past its own fossil fuel interests if it's going to host successful talks.\nMohamad Adow of climate think tank Power Shift Africa said it’s “concerning to be once again having the world’s climate negotiations coordinated by a petrostate that has a big interest in oil and gas production.\" But he was hopeful that climate negotiators could be successful in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku as “the COP in Dubai resulted in an outcome more positive than many expected.”\n“He’s got a huge job to do,\" said Adow. \"He needs to start working on getting rich countries to deliver serious, long-term finance that will tackle the climate crisis.”\nHarjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said that “with another petrostate hosting the climate conference, our concerns multiply.\"\nBabayev \"must transcend the vested interests of the powerful fossil fuel industry that is primarily responsible for the climate crisis,\" Singh said.\nMelanie Robinson, global director for the climate program at World Resources Institute, didn't comment directly on Babayev but said “stakes will be high” in Azerbaijan, where nations will tackle issues including how to finance climate change adaptation and mitigation around the world, particularly in poorer countries.\n“As with all presidencies, the world will be looking to Azerbaijan to fairly facilitate the most ambitious outcome possible,” she said.\nThe United Nations moves the talks around the world with different regions taking turns. They're typically announced two years in advance, but the decision to hold 2024 talks in Azerbaijan came just 11 months before the negotiations are supposed to start.\nThat was due to a longtime standoff between Eastern European nations, the region designated to host in 2024. A prisoner swap between Azerbaijan and Armenia in early December led to Armenia supporting Azerbaijan's COP29 bid.\n___\nAssociated Press science writer Seth Borenstein in Washington and freelance journalist Aida Sultanova in London contributed.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "text": "Letter to the editor: Resolve to take climate action\nThe new year is a time to reflect on the past year and decide what to change. 2023 was the hottest year on record. Antarctic sea ice hit a record low. Historic wildfires in Canada kept Pittsburghers indoors with a code red air quality alert. Phoenix suffered a record-shattering heat wave. As we keep burning fossil fuels, these effects will only intensify and happen more frequently.\nGiven the climate effects we are seeing now, we need to work with urgency to keep our world safe for us, our kids and our grandkids. We have a stark choice between a new, healthy, clean-energy economy and an old, dirty, fossil-fueled economy. We can rebuild our energy economy around healthy solar and wind, switch to electric vehicles and make our homes more energy efficient — saving money and increasing comfort. Conversely, we can hold onto fossil fuels, which, according to the Harvard School of Public Health, “create climate change and release pollutants that lead to early death, heart attacks, respiratory disorders, stroke, asthma, and absenteeism at school and work. It has also been linked to autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer’s disease.”\nThis year, resolve to work for legislation to improve our health and the health of our fevered planet.

        "text": "Amid America’s fluctuating commitment to green energy, shaped by changing political landscapes and varying state policies, renewable energy often finds itself misrepresented in negative narratives. While some criticisms hold a grain of truth, many are baseless or exaggerated.\nFor example:\nSolar panels don’t work when it’s cloudy — debunked.\nRenewable energy is too expensive — It’s only getting cheaper.\nRenewables require too much land to work efficiently — not true.\nThe list goes on. But since it’s National Bird Day, let’s look at one of the more repetitive claims around our winged friends: Wind turbines kill millions of birds every year, more than fossil fuels. While it’s true that wind turbines do lead to bird fatalities, the scale and impact of these deaths are often overstated and pale in comparison to the threat posed by other human-related activities.\nBased on a series of studies from 2013 and 2014, it’s estimated that between 140,000 and 679,000 birds were killed annually by wind turbines in the U.S. Even though this figure likely underestimates the true extent, as many bird fatalities go undetected, the number is significantly lower than other causes of bird deaths.\nJoel Merriman, the bird-smart wind energy campaign director for the American Bird Conservancy, used wind turbine data from 2021 to extrapolate how many more bird deaths there may have been since the 2013 and 2014 studies. He believes the better average to be around 538,000 deaths per year but says other estimates could place it as high as 1 million.\nSounds like a lot. It’s not.\nCollisions with buildings and attacks by domestic cats account for a much higher number of bird fatalities annually, with estimates reaching up to 988 million and 4 billion, respectively.\nAdditionally, a significant number of birds, ranging from 12 to 64 million each year in the U.S., fall victim to power lines, which, to be fair, are also necessary for transmitting electricity from both wind and other energy sources to consumers.\nWind turbine deaths account for around 0.017% of cat-related bird deaths, while that figure increases slightly to 00.69% for buildings. In contrast, fossil fuel-burning power plants kill about 35 times more birds per gigawatt hour than wind turbines at around 24 million in total.\n“It’s clear that we must act on our shared sense of urgency to reverse the effects of climate change, and that means a rapid shift to clean energy,” said Merriman in a recent article he authored. “But we have to do it right. We can’t throw caution to the wind when it comes to our vulnerable and declining bird populations.”\nBut that’s just generating the power. While it’s challenging to quantify the exact number of bird deaths caused by fossil fuels, the indirect impacts through environmental changes are substantial and far-reaching.\nClearing bayous in Louisiana for petrochemical or liquefied natural gas terminals can also disturb and kill large bird populations. Slicing off the top of hills and mountains to make way for different types of mines also accounts for a large number of deaths.\nAround 1 million birds a year are killed from just ingesting plastic.\nBut more than anything, the rapidly changing climate, mainly driven by fossil fuel consumption, poses a far more significant and long-term threat to birds through habitat destruction, extreme weather events, and ecological shifts.\nAccording to multiple studies, the development of wind energy is part of the solution to saving more birds.\nThe latest wind turbine designs and how they are planned will likely slash the number of bird deaths in the future, according to one report. The simplest way to preserve birds, notes the report, is to ensure that wind farms are in areas away from significant bird habitats and their migratory paths. Boom boxes are another solution, emitting high-frequency sounds that can deter bats and birds. Painting the wind turbines purple is another solution since the insects birds most want to eat are less attracted to that color. New designs, radar, and GPS are also expected to help.",

        "text": "In Brief: Massacred Nigerian Christians Deserve Our Outrage\nThe media and public were rightly outraged when Hamas slaughtered Jews. Why don’t Christians get the same sympathy?\nWe and countless others have written at length expressing outrage over the murderous October 7 attack by Hamas against innocent Israelis. We have also written about the slaughter of Nigerian Christians, asking rhetorically if their lives matter. But that slaughter continues without nearly the attention its victims deserve.\nCultural thinker Peter Heck has noticed this. He begins by expressing gratitude for those who’ve devoted attention to the plight of Israel, as well as recommending the interview with a freed hostage, Mia Schem, that went viral.\nI remain both curious and sincerely disappointed, however, that while the horrors of Hamas and the suffering of Israelis has gotten effective media attention, a continuing, gory Christian persecution continues unabated in Nigeria while drawing only the slightest mention in international media, and virtually none this side of the Atlantic.\nBands of armed Muslim men with guns and machetes attacked and killed 198 Christians, and wounded an additional 300.\nBoth the Guardian and Reuters, covering the massacre, found reason to blame the atrocity, at least partially, on climate change and the competition for natural resources it engenders. Seriously.\nIn truth, Heck notes, the reason African Muslims are killing Nigerian Christians is the same as the reason Middle Eastern Muslims are killing Israeli Jews — they refuse to coexist and insist that infidels must die.\nHe puts it in perspective:\nWe are rightfully stunned at the final death tally out of Israel that shows Hamas butchered 1,139 people in cold blood last October 7th. It was the most traumatizing terrorist attack since the state of Israel was formed in 1948.\nSince 2010, nearly 52,000 Nigerian Christians have been murdered because of their faith.\nThese aren’t “clashes” or “conflicts” as described by disinterested and dishonest media. It’s genocide. Heck concludes:\nWhat happened in the streets, houses, music festival, and kibbutz communities in Israel was appalling and shocking to the conscience. Rational people both understand and support the elimination of the instigating terrorists.\nBut with 18,000 Christian churches burned, over 2,000 Christian schools destroyed, and thousands upon thousands of believers hacked to death in their homes and places of worship, it’s well past time for the civilized world to offer Nigerian Christians the same support.\n- Tags:\n- Nigeria\n- Christians\n- Peter Heck\nStart a conversation using these share links:",

        "text": "Manteca’s water use in December increased at a rate three times that of housing growth.\nGiven that outside landscape irrigation is at a bare minimum in December, it provides an insight into in-house water use.\nOutside water use typically accounts for more than 50 percent of a Manteca household’s annual water use.\nManteca used 263.8 million gallons of water last month.\nThat’s up 9 percent over December 2022 when water consumption was at 241 million gallons.\nThe city’s annual population growth rate is just under 3 percent.\nThe December 2022 water use was up 2.2 percent from December 2021. That is more in line with the growth rate.\nInside the house, flushing toilets is the No. 1 use of water followed by baths/showers, washing clothes, and then dish washing.\nAll new homes have low-flow toilets as do a number of pre-1995 houses that have been retrofitted.\nThose with older homes and toilets that do not meet the current high efficiency rating of 1.28 gallons per flush are eligible for $75 rebates from the City of Manteca when they buy replacement toilets.\nThe rebate in most cases covers the majority of the cost of the replacement toilet. Rebates, however, can’t exceed the price of the new toilet.\nRebates are also available for high efficiency washing machines that have a water use factor of 7.1 or less. The rebate is for $100.\nThere is also a turf replacement program for converting to less water intense landscaping.\nThe rebate is $1 per square foot. There is a $650 maximum for residential users and $5,000 for commercial.\nDetails regarding the three rebate programs are on the City of Manteca’s website.\nWhile the state’s reservoirs are all near normal capacity, all of takes is two or so years of below normal precipitation and available water supplies can become a concern.\nDwindling groundwater, the historic drought conditions in California that have been exacerbated by growth, and climate change have all made wise water use a key concern for jurisdictions even in normal or wet years.\nAnd while the water year that started Oct. 1 still has three of the four wettest months to go, last month was the fourth driest December in California for snow since measurements started to be taken in the 1850s.\nLikewise, rainfall in the Manteca-Ripon-Lathrop area is lagging.\nAs of Wednesday, it was 83 percent of normal as 4.03 inches had fallen since July. The normal by Jan. 3 in a typical year is 4.83 inches of rainfall.\nTo contact Dennis Wyatt, email dwyatt@mantecabulletin.com",

        "text": "New Year resolutions are often sweeping and grand, but often you can reap the biggest rewards by building off the strengths already in place. Helping to make your family safer, stronger and more harmonious in 2024 may not require a complete overhaul, but rather a few strategic tweaks.\nHere are eight goals for parents and caregivers:\n• Get everyone up-to-date on recommended immunizations. Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself, your children and other loved ones from dangerous viruses such as flu and COVID, which are spiking among children. Call your pediatrician to make sure your children are up-to-date on all recommended immunizations, and ask any questions you may have. And remind your children that good hand hygiene habits help prevent the spread of germs.\n• Do good digital. What are your kids watching on TV and online? Devote some time to researching age-appropriate media. Make a family media use plan and try to prevent gaming from becoming an unhealthy habit. Remember that screen time shouldn’t always be done solo. Watch a show together and discuss what’s happening. Play a video game together. Screen time can become bonding time when adults are active participants.\n• Read together. Set aside time for reading each day. For younger children, build it into the bedtime routine. For older children and teens, share a favorite book by taking turns reading aloud or listen to audiobooks together. Reading has so many brain-boosting benefits for kids. Reading together also strengthens that special bond between you and your child.\n• Get outside and explore. Spending time outdoors can be a great mood booster, and help families get needed physical activity and vitamin D while enjoying time in nature. Spending time outside also gives your child’s eyes a healthy screen-time break and helps them sleep better at night.\n• Check your car seat limits for safety. Kids grow so fast and they can easily outgrow car seats faster than parents realize. Keep children riding rear-facing as long as possible, up to the limits of their car seat, because it is the safest mode. This commonly includes children under 2 and most children up to age 4. See if there are any new car seat laws that may be going into effect in your state in the new year. Remind anyone who transports your child by car to abide by all safety rules.\n• Set aside time to cook as a family. Many families enjoy baking treats together during the holidays. Keep the fun going in the new year. Schedule special times to cook together and get children involved, from choosing recipes to buying ingredients at the store. If your child is a picky eater, this can get them more interested in trying new, healthy foods.\n• Make a family disaster kit. It’s scary to think how disasters like wildfires, hurricanes or tornadoes could affect our communities, but extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Being ready is one way to be less afraid. Ask your children what they would want with them in a disaster and assemble basic necessities, like nonperishable foods, flashlights, and bottled water, for when a disaster strikes.\n• Mind your mental health and practice self-care. When was the last time you had a check-up? Got proper rest? Depression and anxiety can happen to both moms and dads during and after pregnancy, even up to three years after having a child. The National Maternal Mental Health Hotline is available 24/7 by calling 833-943-5746. And for non-emergency resources and support, you can contact Postpartum Support International: call or text “Help” to 800-944-4773.\nMaybe this is the year you decide to join a parent’s group — or step back from some activities if you find it hard to say no and are overextended. Your pediatrician can help you with your child’s health, but also provide some guidance on self-care for parents. When caregivers are healthy and rested, they are better equipped to provide the best care for their children.\nEven very young children can also make their own goals and resolutions.

        "text": "(The Center Square) – At least two of the recently submitted citizen initiatives to the Legislature from the taxpayer advocacy group Let’s Go Washington may be officially certified before the start of next week’s legislative session.\nThat would make them a much higher priority for time and attention for state lawmakers, knowing if they do nothing during the 60-day session, all six measures would appear as written on the fall 2024 ballot.\n“I believe all six initiatives have been provisionally certified, which I believe means they have enough signatures if the rejection rate is kind of the standard rejection rate,” House Speaker Rep. Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said during Thursday’s pre-session meeting of legislative leaders before members of the press in Olympia.\nShe went on to say, “We won’t get final certification until mid-February, so that means they may not be referred to committee until then.”\nJinkins added, “I’m very saddened when I think of why the initiative process was established in this state.”\nShe decried the group behind the initiatives, Let’s Go Washington, and its founder, Brian Heywood.\n“Now what we have is an ultra-wealthy multi-millionaire buying his way onto the ballot, to benefit his ultra-wealthy status,” Jinkins said.\nShe concluded, “We’ll have to make decisions about whether or not those are heard, or whether or not we’ll consider alternatives … I have a great deal of confidence in voters.”\nSen. John Braun, R-Auburn, fired back.\n“People care about climate change of course, but they also think it should be something we can handle without breaking the backs of hard-working Washingtonians,” the Senate Republican leader retorted.\nHe was referencing the Climate Commitment Act and the higher gas prices that followed its implementation at the beginning of 2023.\nRepealing the state’s cap-and-trade law is the focus of one of the initiatives. The others concerns police pursuits, the long-term care payroll tax, capital gains taxes, local income taxes, and parental notification concerning education.\n“I have to push back on the timeline, as the Secretary of State’s office has said two of the initiatives should be officially certified before next week, and constitutionally we are supposed to consider those top priorities, right after the budget,” Braun added.\n“There should be two issues next Monday, whichever are certified and he [the Secretary of State’s Office] did say the last one should be certified by Feb. 9, so we ought to be focused on these right away and we can talk about how they got on the ballot, that’s an easy way to distract from the fact that we had a record number of voters signing these petitions, it’s because they are frustrated.”\nMore than 2.6 million registered voters signed the petitions in all.\nRep. Drew Stokesbary R-Auburn, then brought up the Stuart Elway Poll released Thursday in partnership with Crosscut.\n“Washingtonians want to be heard, with more than 400-thousand voters signing each of the measures,” the Republican house leader added. “Fifty-seven percent said they want to repeal the capital gains tax, about 60% want to reform police pursuit laws, clearly there is an appetite for change and it’s time to fix what’s broken.”\nSen. Andy Billig, D-Spokane, told reporters all the initiatives “seek to roll back progress, and I have confidence in voters that once all the information gets out there, people do want to take part in the responsibility for climate change, and maybe we do come up with some ways to make it better, I mean on the CCA there’s the idea of linking with Quebec and California and I think everyone agrees that’s a good idea.”\nThe Senate majority leader went on to say, “I saw in the poll people want lower taxes. I want lower taxes, too. And people want more investment in state services. I want that, too. It’s hard to have both. The people will get their say.”\nThe 60-day legislative session begins Monday, Jan. 8.",

Activists have concerns\nAzerbaijan’s ecology minister has been named to lead the United Nations’ annual climate talks later this year, prompting concern from some climate activists over his former ties to the state oil company in a major oil-producing nation.\nMukhtar Babayev’s appointment was announced on X by the United Arab Emirates, which hosted the climate talks that just ended in December, and confirmed Friday by the United Nations. Officials in Azerbaijan did not immediately respond to messages seeking to confirm the appointment.\nBabayev, 56, has been his country’s minister for ecology and natural resources since 2018.

        "text": "This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nLast year, climate change came into sharp relief for much of the world: The planet experienced its hottest 12-month period in 125,000 years. Flooding events inundated communities from California to East Africa to India. A heat wave in South America caused temperatures to spike above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of winter, and a heat dome across much of the southern United States spurred a 31-day streak in Phoenix of 110 degree-plus temperatures. The formation of an El Niño, the natural phenomenon that raises temperatures globally, intensified extreme weather already strengthened by climate change. The US alone counted 25 billion-dollar weather disasters in 2023—more than any other year.\nYet this devastation was met by some of the largest gains in climate action to date. World leaders agreed for the first time to “transition away” from oil and gas at the annual United Nations climate summit, hosted last month by the United Arab Emirates. Funds and incentives from President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, started to roll out to companies and municipalities. Electric vehicle sales skyrocketed, thousands of young people signed up for the first-ever American Climate Corps, and companies agreed to pay billions of dollars to remove harmful chemicals called PFAS from drinking water supplies.\nAs we enter a new year, we asked Grist reporters what big stories they’re watching on their beats, 24 predictions for 2024. Their forecasts depict a world on the cusp of change in regard to climate—both good and bad, and often in tandem. Here’s what we’re keeping an eye on, from hard-won international financial commitments, to battles over mining in-demand minerals like lithium, to the expansion of renewable energy.\nPOLITICS & POLICY\n1. A new climate corps will turn young people’s anxiety into action.\nThe American Climate Corps will officially kick off in the summer of 2024, sending 20,000 18- to 26-year-olds across the country to install solar projects, mitigate wildfire risk, and make homes more energy-efficient. President Biden’s New Deal-inspired program is modeled after Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Climate Conservation Corps and attracted 100,000 applicants. As it rolls out, the climate corps will continue to draw criticism from the left for low wages and ageism, and from the right for being a “made-up government work program … for young liberal activists.” Yet the program will remain popular with the public, bolstering towns’ resilience to weather disasters and training thousands of young people to help fill the country’s shortage of skilled workers needed for decarbonization. —Kate Yoder\n2. Despite rising temperatures, climate change takes a backseat during the 2024 election.\nAlthough more than a decade of surveys and polls show that a growing proportion of Americans are concerned about climate change, it has never been a defining issue in a general election—and will likely remain that way in 2024, at least on the main stage. Put simply, there are too many immediate concerns that will dominate the campaign trail as President Joe Biden faces off against the Republican nominee—most likely former President Donald Trump: Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, Israel’s war against Hamas, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the fight for abortion rights, new charges against Biden’s son, Hunter, and, of course, the numerous criminal charges against Trump. Biden may herald his signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, in his own messaging, but climate change is unlikely to cross party lines. —Zoya Teirstein\n3. A climate reparations fund gets off the ground.\nDuring COP28, the UN climate conference that took place in Dubai last year, countries agreed to set up a climate reparations fund on an interim basis at the World Bank. The fund was a longtime priority of developing countries and climate justice advocates who argued that nations that had contributed negligibly to a warming planet were facing the consequences. This year, the World Bank is expected to set up the fund and begin disbursing money to poor nations. Board members will be selected, an executive director will be appointed, decisions about how countries can access the money will be made, and money will begin flowing to those in need. During COP28, wealthy countries chipped in more than $650 million to the fund. More money will also fill the coffers this year. —Naveena Sadasivam\n4. “Greenhushing” spreads as companies seek to dodge lawsuits.\nJust a few years ago, splashy corporate climate promises were everywhere. Even oil companies promised to cut their emissions. But there won’t be as many misleading advertisements touting companies’ climate progress in 2024. Amid new regulations against false environmental marketing and a pileup of greenwashing lawsuits, more corporations will join in hiding their climate commitments to avoid scrutiny. This trend of “greenhushing” ramped up in 2023, when 1 in 5 companies declined to publicly release their sustainability targets, a threefold increase from the prior year. While this makes it harder to see what companies are doing, California’s new “anti-greenwashing” law, which went into effect on January 1, will tackle the transparency problem by requiring companies to disclose their carbon emissions. —Kate Yoder\n5. A global treaty to end plastic pollution faces delays.\nDelegates from around the world have been working to finalize a UN treaty by the end of 2024 that will “end plastic pollution.” They’ve had three negotiating sessions so far, and two more are scheduled for later this year. Despite signs of progress, petrochemical industry interests have resisted the most ambitious proposals to limit plastic production—they’d prefer a treaty focused on cleaning up plastic litter and improving plastic recycling rates. After countries failed to make significant headway at the most recent round of talks, it’s now possible that an extended deadline will be needed to deliver the final treaty. To some involved in the talks, that’s OK if it’ll mean a stronger agreement. But the pressure is still on, as every year without a treaty means more unchecked plastic pollution. —Joseph Winters\nENERGY\n6. A deluge of new household electrification and efficiency rebates.\nWhen the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, some decarbonization incentives were quickly accessible—such as tax credits for solar and heat pump installation—but others have taken longer to kick in. The wait, however, is almost over, and 2024 is set to see a slew of new, or expanded, opportunities come online. The Inflation Reduction Act earmarked $8.8 billion for residential electrification and energy-use reduction, especially in low-income households.Think things like induction cooktops and energy-efficient clothes dryers, which don’t currently have federally funded rebates. The Department of Energy is in the process of allocating funding to participating states, which will be in charge of getting the money into Americans’ pockets. —Tik Root\n7. A push for public power takes root in communities nationwide.\nAcross the country, close to a dozen communities are exploring ways to replace their investor-owned electric utilities with publicly owned ones. Advocates say they want to lower electricity costs, improve reliability, and speed up a clean energy transition. While a referendum in Maine to create a statewide publicly owned utility failed this past November, supporters elsewhere are just getting started. Next year, a group in San Diego could succeed in getting a vote for a municipal utility on the ballot. Decorah, Iowa, is contemplating a similar vote, and ongoing efforts could gain traction in San Francisco, the South San Joaquin Irrigation District in California, New Mexico, and Rochester, New York. —Akielly Hu\n8. Puerto Rico becomes be a US leader in residential solar energy adoption.\nWhile the nationwide rate of residential-solar installations is expected to shrink by more than 10 percent next year, due to interest rates and changes in California’s net-metering rules, installations show no sign of slowing down in Puerto Rico. The archipelago of 1.2 million households already installs 3,400 residential rooftop solar and battery-storage systems per month. In spring 2024, the Energy Department will begin deploying $440 million in residential-solar funding, which they say will be enough for about 30,000 homes. Analysts predict that by 2030, one-quarter of Puerto Rico households will have photovoltaic systems, though that depends in part on whether Puerto Rico passes a pending bill that would protect net metering until then. —Gabriela Aoun Angueira\nBUSINESS & TECH\n9. Changes to the federal tax credit will improve EV access for lower-income drivers.\nAs of January 1, consumers can redeem the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-vehicle tax credit directly at car dealerships. Last year, the $7,500 incentive for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for previously owned ones were only available as a credit, meaning that car buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to get any benefit. The point-of-sale rebate will make getting a clean vehicle more accessible to buyers who can’t afford a hefty down payment, or whose income is too low to owe taxes. But their model options will also shrink—the Treasury Department just proposed rules disqualifying cars with battery components or minerals that come from countries deemed hostile to the US. —Gabriela Aoun Angueira\n10. Carbon-capture tech will continue to boom (and be controversial).\nIn some ways, it was a mixed year for carbon capture. While the world’s largest carbon-capture plant broke ground in Texas, the builders of a major carbon dioxide pipeline—which would be used to transport captive emissions to their final destination underground—canceled the project in the face of regulatory pushback. Climate activists have also long been skeptical of carbon capture as an industry ruse to keep burning fossil fuels. Overall, though, the carbon-capture market is surging on the tailwinds of largely favorable government policies in recent years. The use of the technology is also spreading beyond traditional sectors, such as natural gas facilities, into other industrial arenas, including cement, steel, and iron manufacturing. Next year will bring some continued hiccups but, overwhelmingly, continued growth. —Tik Root\n11. Republicans ramp up their war on “woke” ESG investing.\nAn ongoing Republican crusade against ESG investing—shorthand for the environmental, social, and governance criteria investors use to evaluate companies—could end up costing retirees and insurers millions in lost returns next year. GOP lawmakers claim that considering climate risks while making investments imposes “woke” values and limits investment returns. Yet anti-ESG laws passed in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas last year were estimated to have cost taxpayers up to hundreds of millions of dollars. That’s partly because most Wall Street banks and businesses still employ ESG strategies. The backlash could continue through next year’s election—presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy have both taken strong anti-ESG positions. —Akielly Hu\n12. Unions expand their fight for electric vehicle worker protections.\nUnited Auto Workers recently won provisions for electric vehicle employees after a sweeping strike at Detroit’s Big Three carmakers—Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors. Now, the union has launched organizing campaigns at 13 non-union shops, including at EV leaders like Tesla and at other companies just getting into the EV space, such as Volkswagen and Hyundai. Next year, these campaigns will begin to go public, with resulting walkouts, negotiations, and expected union-busting tactics. Such efforts have failed in the past, and some companies have announced wage increases to entice workers away from a potential union drive, but UAW has already announced thousands of new member sign-ups and filed labor grievances against several companies, signaling a hard-headed approach that may win new contracts to protect workers as the auto industry increasingly shifts toward EVs. —Katie Myers\nENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE\n13. The EPA will back away from using civil rights laws to protect residents.\nIn 2020, a federal judge ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to start investigating the complaints it receives under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in any program that gets funding from the federal government. Since then, communities around the country have attempted to use the law to achieve environmental justice in their backyards. But after the agency dropped its highest profile civil rights case in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” following a lawsuit from the state attorney general, advocates worry that the legal avenue won’t fulfill its promise. In 2024, it’s likely that the EPA will pursue Title VI complaints in states with cooperative environment agencies, but shy away from pressuring industry-friendly states like Louisiana and Texas to make big changes based on the law. —Lylla Younes\n14. Additional testing will reveal the true scope of “forever chemical” pollution.\nMajor chemical manufacturers like 3M, DuPont, and Chemours were forced to strike multibillion-dollar settlements last year with coalitions of states, cities, and townships over PFAS—the deadly “forever chemicals” these companies knowingly spewed into the environment for decades. 2024 will be a big year for determining just how pervasive this problem is in US water supplies. New hotspots are likely to emerge as the EPA conducts additional testing across the country, particularly in areas where little data on the chemicals currently exists. New fights over forever chemicals will also unfold in places like Minnesota, where lawmakers have introduced a bill that would require 3M and other large chemical corporations to pay for medical testing for PFAS-exposed communities, and in North Carolina, where the United Nations just declared PFAS pollution a human rights violation. —Zoya Teirstein\n15. A booming liquefied natural gas industry goes bust…maybe.\nThe liquefied natural gas industry is booming on the US Gulf Coast as companies export huge amounts of fracked gas to Europe and Asia, but the buildout of liquefaction facilities in the South has stumbled in recent months. A federal court revoked one facility’s permit in Texas, and the federal Department of Energy denied another company seeking an extension to build a facility in Louisiana. The coming year will be a big test for the nascent business: If courts and regulators delay more of these expensive projects, the companies behind them may abandon them and instead try building smaller, cheaper terminals elsewhere in the United States or even offshore. —Jake Bittle\n16. Polluting countries could be legally liable to vulnerable ones.\nAt COP28, negotiators from small island states sought to hold larger countries financially accountable for their outsize role in fueling carbon emissions. In 2024, that issue could be decided in international courts: As soon as March, the International Court of Justice will weigh arguments regarding countries’ obligations under international law to protect current and future generations from the harmful effects of climate change. The case brought by Vanuatu raises the question of how much big polluters owe island nations, with Vanuatu and other Pacific island communities particularly affected by rising sea levels and worsening storms. —Anita Hofschneider\nLAND USE\n17. Mining for critical minerals takes off, as new discoveries and investments are made.\nDiscoveries of major new deposits of rare earths and other minerals critical to the expansion of renewable energy will continue to explode in the western and southeastern US—places like the Salton Sea in California and a lithium belt in North Carolina—as well as in Alaska. These developments, alongside incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, will bolster domestic mining and renewable energy industries in 2024. Many of these discoveries are being made in coalfields and oil fields by fossil fuel companies looking to diversify their portfolios. In response, expect a boom in the efforts to reform laws around the poorly regulated mining industry as well as community-driven activism against places like the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. —Katie Myers\n18. Congress doles out funds for unproven “climate-smart” agriculture.\nThis could be the biggest year yet for “climate-smart” agriculture. Billions of dollars that Congress earmarked a year and a half ago in the Inflation Reduction Act are starting to flow to farmers planting trees and cover crops that sequester carbon. Lawmakers will have the chance to carve out even more funds in the farm bill, the sprawling legislative package that will be up for renewal next year. But climate advocates won’t be satisfied with all of the results: The fight over what counts as “climate smart” will heat up as subsidies go to tools like methane digesters, which some advocates blame for propping up big polluters. —Max Graham\n19. More renewable energy comes to public lands.\nThe Bureau of Land Management controls a tenth of the land base in the US—some 245 millions acres. The Biden administration has been trying to utilize that public land for renewable energy projects and infrastructure, with the Department of Interior recently announcing 15 such initiatives. The department is also aiming to reduce fees to promote solar and wind development. These efforts have run into roadblocks in the past, including from Indigenous nations. For example, the Tohono O’odham Nation and San Carlos Apache Tribe challenged a transmission line in southern Arizona because of its potential to harm cultural sites. But with the goal of permitting 25 gigawatts of renewable energy on BLM land by 2025, expect the federal government to continue pushing its buildout next year. —Tik Root\nCLIMATE IMPACTS\n20. El Niño peaks, bringing a preview of life in the 2030s.\nLast year brought the onset of the latest cycle of El Niño, a natural phenomenon that spurs the formation of a band of warm water in the Pacific Ocean and fuels above-average temperatures globally. In fact, the cycle has already nudged the world over 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming for the first time. Because these systems tend to peak from December to April, the worst impacts will likely hit in the first half of 2024. Scientists predict the world will experience its hottest summer on record, giving us a preview of what life will look like in the 2030s. El Niño has already spurred an onslaught of knock-on effects, including heat waves in South America, flooding in East Africa, and infectious disease outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean. This year, researchers expect El Niño will lead to an unusually strong hurricane season in the Pacific, impact agricultural production and food security, lead to more explosions of vector-borne diseases, and depress the global economy. In some places, this is already happening. —Zoya Teirstein\n21. To migrate or not: Pacific islanders weigh their options.\nLast year, a proposed treaty between Australia and Tuvalu made international headlines for a unique provision: migration rights for climate refugees from the Pacific island country, which is at particular risk of rising seas. Now, Tuvalu’s general election, set for later this month, may serve as a de facto referendum on the agreement. But the country’s voters aren’t the only ones weighing their options as their islands slowly sink. The coming year will bring more attention to the plight of Pacific Islanders who are confronting a future of forced migration and grappling with the question of where their communities will go, what rights they’ll have, and how their sovereignty will persist. —Anita Hofschneider\n22. Insurers flee more disaster-prone states.\nCalifornia. Louisiana. Florida. Who’s next? The insurance markets in these hurricane- and fire-prone states have descended into turmoil over the past few years as private companies drop policyholders and flee local markets after expensive disasters. State regulators are stepping in to stop this downward spiral, but stable insurance markets will mean higher prices for homeowners, especially in places like low-lying Miami, where the average insurance premium is already around $300 a month. The next year will see the same kind of insurance crisis pop up in other states such as Hawaiʻi, Oregon, and South Carolina, as private carriers try to stem their climate-induced losses. —Jake Bittle\n23. Despite barriers, workplace heat standards make slow progress.\nEarlier this year, Miami-Dade County in Florida—where the region’s humidity makes outdoor workers especially vulnerable to extreme heat—was poised to pass one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful workplace heat standards in the country. Instead, county commissioners bowed to pressure from industry groups, and the vote was deferred. On the national level, OSHA, the agency responsible for workplace safety, has been in the process of creating a federal heat standard for over two years. That work is far from over, and it seems unlikely that the agency will announce a finalized rule next year, despite record-breaking heat. That leaves states and municipalities to lead the way in 2024 for worker-heat protections, but as was the case in Miami-Dade, local officials will likely face obstacles from powerful industry groups as they do so. —Siri Chilukuri\n24. “Heatflation” comes for desserts.\nHeatflation came for condiments like olive oil and sriracha in 2023. This year, it’ll strike desserts. Unusually dry weather and a poor sugar cane harvest in India and Thailand—two of the world’s biggest producers—have driven global sugar prices to their highest level in more than a decade. Heavy rainfall in West Africa has led to widespread rot on the region’s prolific cocoa farms, causing chocolate prices to soar and snack companies like Mondelēz, which makes Oreos, to warn of more expensive products in 2024. And an extra-hot year fueled by a strong El Niño could be a rough one for wheat growers and flour prices. So now’s the time to indulge in chocolate cake—before it’s too late. —Max Graham",

        "text": "UN has a plan to curb farm emissions. Are farmers willing to try it?\nCrop fertilizers, food storage, transportation, and waste create almost a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. The COP28 UN climate summit revealed a roadmap for greater efficiency in the food system rather than a shift toward sustainable farming.\n| New Delhi\nThe first-ever United Nations roadmap for cutting climate-heating emissions from the world’s farming sector, unveiled at the COP28 U.N. climate summit in December, has stirred debate around how to share fairly the burden of shifting to greener ways.\nSome agricultural experts are calling for fertilizers and other agro-chemicals – whose production relies heavily on fossil fuels – to be completely phased out, while others say poorer countries will continue to need them to improve low crop yields.\nFood systems – including growing methods, inputs like fertilizers, storage, transportation, and waste – account for nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.\nThe new plan, presented by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), targets an end to hunger and malnutrition without breaching the most ambitious Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nIt proposes measures to boost farm productivity while emitting less methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases in 10 domains – from using clean energy and restoring soil and pastures, to reducing chemical inputs, food loss, and waste.\nIt also aims for a “just transition” in agriculture by making a distinction between the actions that rich and poor countries should take based on “improved efficiency” and “global rebalancing” of resources for farming and food supplies.\nAnd it proposes that wealthy countries should cut their high consumption of animal-source foods to enable developing nations to increase theirs without damaging the climate and nature.\nThe roadmap is the first of a set the FAO will unveil at three annual climate summits, starting with this year’s global overview and detailing next how to make food systems work better for people and the planet at the regional and country levels.\nEmile Frison, of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, welcomed the initial plan and “its emphasis on a just transition.” But, he added in a statement, it does not go far enough because it focuses only on incremental improvements to today’s “flawed” industrial food system.\n“These efficiency-first proposals are unlikely to be enough to get us off the high pollution, high fossil fuel, high hunger track we’re on,” said the conservation and biodiversity expert.\nPatty Fong, program director at the Global Alliance for the Future of Food – which unites almost 30 philanthropic foundations – said making food systems truly sustainable would require a commitment to phase out fossil fuels along the entire value chain, from farm to fork.\nThe roadmap, however, calls for less fertilizer use through greater efficiency rather than a wholesale shift towards sustainable farming practices like agro-ecology, she noted.\nOthers argued that chemical fertilizers remain essential for boosting food security in developing countries with low crop yields and a high proportion of smallholder farmers.\nAditi Mukherji, of the CGIAR global research partnership on food systems, said solutions should be context-specific – and sustainable intensification of agriculture is needed in poorer regions with low productivity.\n“But certainly, this is not true of high-income countries,” she told Context.\nIn many low-income countries, higher agricultural efficiency and stronger climate resilience would result in lower emissions by minimizing crop losses and post-harvest waste, she noted.\nIndian farmers struggle\nThese debates are playing out on the ground in countries like India, where agriculture is the biggest employer, supporting the livelihoods of 250 million farmers and laborers.\nTheir work is getting tougher as climate change makes living off farming difficult, pushing up debt, migration, and even suicides. Worries over falling yields have driven the rising use of chemical fertilizers in general.\nHowever, a growing number of smallholder farmers are trying out green approaches that promote organic, natural, or sustainable methods. Their scale and success will hinge on how well they can protect incomes, agricultural experts told Context.\nFor instance, despite having heard of many farmers switching to natural cultivation methods, Shashikant Shukla continues to grow wheat and pulses using chemical inputs on his half acre of land in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh state.\nHis yields and income have been squeezed by erratic monsoon rains, unseasonal downpours, and early heatwaves – fueled by climate change – together with rising costs for fertilizers and other overheads.\n“I am constantly living in debt; I do not have the courage to experiment on my farm,” said Mr. Shukla, who makes up for his climate-related harvest losses by working as a driver-for-hire.\nEven if he does try growing organic wheat, he would end up selling it at the same price as conventional wheat – and if it leads to a dip in yields, “it will break my back,” he added.\nSwitching to natural farming often causes a drop in yields in the initial years before harvests gradually pick up – something most poor Indian farmers can ill absorb.\nThey rely on government purchases of their staple crops such as rice and wheat at guaranteed prices, and rarely have money in reserve to change their practices without outside support.\nDevinder Sharma, an independent expert on agricultural policy, told Context that India needs to move towards ecological farming practices, but green initiatives will only achieve cosmetic changes unless farmers are offered an assured income.\nSmallholder farmers Context spoke to for a recent series on achieving a just green transition in Indian agriculture identified a range of challenges – from lack of access to good-quality seeds and markets with premium prices, to low availability of natural manure and high labor costs.\nMr. Sharma said they would benefit from a government-backed guaranteed price for naturally grown produce, as well as subsidies to cover any losses and stronger marketing channels.\nClimate finance gap\nA widespread shift to low-carbon, climate-resilient food production, as outlined in the new U.N. roadmap, will succeed only if it puts farmers at the center and provides the finance, infrastructure, and technology they need to adapt to more extreme weather and adopt greener practices, experts said.\nAnother FAO report complementing the 1.5C blueprint warned that too little climate finance is flowing to agriculture.\nBetween 2000 and 2021, agri-food systems received about $183 billion, or just 4% of overall climate finance flows, the report said, noting that the annual allocation for farming fell 12% to $19 billion in 2021, while hundreds of billions are required.\nFurthermore, in that same year, only 0.3% of international climate finance from public and private sources reached smallholder farmers – who will need the most support in the transition to sustainable agriculture, according to a separate analysis by Amsterdam-based think-tank Climate Focus.\nThey and other marginalized groups should be able to participate in working out how to transform global food systems, said Ms. Fong, of the Global Alliance for the Future of Food.\n“Grassroots producers – particularly smallholder farmers, women, and Indigenous communities – must be included in all discussions,” she said in a statement on the FAO roadmap.\nThis story was reported by The Thomson Reuters Foundation.",

        "text": "BLM seeks public input on impact of lifting protections on 28 million acres in Alaska\nThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comments on so-called D-1 lands that cover 28 million acres in Alaska and could soon lose federal protections.\nThe lands were set aside under section 17(d)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. The intent was to reserve undeveloped land for future claims by Native corporations and the state. But they were never conveyed, and over the last two decades, BLM has been reevaluating the status of this land.\nIf protections on these 28 million acres are lifted, the land could be opened for mineral entry and state management—including large swathes of land surrounding the area where Graphite One wants to build a mine north of Nome.\nOn Dec. 15, BLM published a nearly 400-page draft of an environmental impact statement, or EIS, that outlines the potential impacts of revoking these protections. The document is meant to guide U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in her decision whether to lift the D-1 protections.\nThe draft EIS examines four possible options. Alternative A would retain all D-1 protections, while Alternative D would lift all D-1 protections. Under Alternatives B and C, some protections would be retained and some would be lifted.\nThe Bering Sea Interior Tribal Commission, which represents 38 tribes in Western Alaska and the Interior, is advocating for all protections to be retained. The newly formed group is also seeking to create co-management agreements with federal agencies like BLM so that member tribes can have more say on what happens in these D-1 lands, according to Alaska Public Media. The Holy Cross tribe recently won a $1.2 million federal grant to form conservation district across this land with other tribes in the commission. It would be “the first indigenous sovereign habitat Tribal conservation district,” according to the November announcement of grants given through the America the Beautiful Challenge.\n“With the released Draft EIS, the Bering Sea Interior Tribal Commission will continue its advocacy for the no-action alternative to protect millions of acres of Tribes’ ancestral land and safeguard Indigenous peoples’ traditional landscapes that not only support food security but give essential meaning to culture and way of life,” a statement from the group said.\nFrank Katchatag, vice chair of the Bering Sea Interior Tribal Commission and president of the Native Village of Unalakleet added: “Once our lands are scarred and our waters spoiled, they will never be the same. We are calling on the Bureau of Land Management to honor our culture and traditions and protect these lands just as we have always done.”\nAccording to BLM’s draft, revoking all protections would result in the loss of federal subsistence priority in more than one million acres of use areas.\nOther groups—including SalmonState, Mother Kuskokwim Tribal Coalition, Norton Bay Watershed Council and Wild Salmon Center—have also advocated for all D-1 protections to remain in place.\n“These 28 million acres represent some of the largest intact landscapes left in the country,” Emily Murray, of Elim, vice president of the Norton Bay Watershed Council, said in a press statement. “The Seward Peninsula and Alaska are experiencing one of the quickest rates of climate change in the United States. These lands’ migratory connectivity and the natural climate refugia they provide are essential to buffer critical resources against rapidly changing conditions, so that communities can continue to practice traditional ways of life.”\nD-1 lands in the Seward Peninsula include areas that surround the site where Graphite One wants to build its mine. The company is still exploring the possibility of creating a graphite mine on state land in the Kigualik Mountains. It has said it will need to design a much bigger mine than initially proposed based on projected demand for graphite, a key component in electric vehicle batteries.\nGraphite One might have more land available for mineral extraction under some of the alternatives that BLM is considering. If D-1 protections are revoked on this land, it will be conveyed to the state and become more likely to be developed.\n“Although the Graphite One mine could be developed on existing State lands regardless of whether the Secretary revokes the 17(d)(1) withdrawals, lands adjacent to those lands could experience expanded or additional development,” the draft EIS says. “In 2019 and 2021, the State of Alaska requested that the BLM open lands around the Graphite One Mine site to allow State selection (with high priority) and resulting conveyance.”\nBLM has invited the public to submit comments until Feb. 14.\nThey can be submitted online through the “Participate Now” link at the BLM National NEPA Register: https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2018002/510\nComments can also be delivered by mail, addressed to:\nAttn: ANCSA 17(d)(1) Withdrawals EIS, Anchorage District Office, 4700 BLM Road, Anchorage, AK 99507.",

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\nThe Ultimate Twosome\nNukes and Climate Change in 2024\nHonestly, what strange creatures we are. Nothing stops us when it comes to destruction, does it? (And I\'m not even thinking about the utter, ongoing devastation of Gaza.)\nI mean, give us credit as the new year begins. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about humanity isn\'t our literature, our theater, our movies, the remarkable food we cook, the cities we\'ve built, or the endless other things we\'ve created. To my mind, it\'s the fact that, in our relatively brief time as rulers of this planet, amid a chaos of never-ending wars and conflicts, we\'ve come up with not just one but two different ways of doing ourselves (and much of the rest of our world) in.\nAnd that, to my mind, is no small achievement.\nGo back a couple of centuries and, even amid humanity\'s wars and other conflicts, someone suggesting such a possible future would undoubtedly have been laughed out of the room. It took science fiction especially H.G. Wells imagining the arrival of murderous Martians to begin to conceive of such all-too-modern, all-too-apocalyptic world-ending possibilities.\nNow, however, there\'s no need for fiction at all. There can be no question that, in its "wisdom" (and yes, that definitely needs to be in quotation marks), humanity has indeed come up with two different ways of utterly destroying this planet as a livable habitat.\nAnd there\'s no mystery here, either. One is, of course, atomic weaponry. First tested out in the New Mexican desert in July 1945, atomic bombs were then dropped on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that August with devastating effect. Ever since, such weaponry has been held in what might be thought of as an ultimate reserve of potential total destructiveness. Yes, in its two times in use, such weaponry lit up the skies in a blinding fashion, destroying much of those two Japanese cities and slaughtering hundreds of thousands of human beings, both in the moment and in the years that followed from the long-term effects of radiation.\nAnd yet, to put that in perspective, those A-bombs, "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" as their American creators dubbed them, used on August 6 and 9, 1945, would today be considered the most modest of "tactical" or "low-yield" nuclear weapons. The major weapons now in the American and Russian arsenals, hydrogen bombs, are perhaps the best word might be blindingly more powerful. As the Union of Concerned Scientists explains, "The warheads on just one U.S. nuclear-armed submarine have seven times the destructive power of all the bombs dropped during World War II, including the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan. And the United States usually has ten of those submarines at sea."\nAnd while, in 1945, only the United States had such weapons, that was bound to change all too quickly. Today, nine countries have nuclear arsenals and there are, at present, nearly 13,000 nuclear weapons on this planet. In the years to come, it\'s not likely to end there either, though that would be more than enough weaponry to destroy not just the Earth but untold numbers of other planets. And keep in mind that the major nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, are both in the process of "modernizing" their arsenals, while China is visibly rushing to catch up. The U.S. is, in fact, expected to put up to $2 trillion (no, that is not a misprint!) into updating its supply of nukes in the decades to come.\nA Nuclear Little Ice Age?\nOn another cheery note, North Korea, which only joined that crew of nine relatively recently, tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile as 2023 ended. (And don\'t think it\'s the last country that\'s going to go nuclear either.) In addition, what nuclear agreements once existed between the great powers are now largely extinct. Worse yet, with both the major and minor nuclear powers still working hard to build up or "modernize" those arsenals into the distant future, the ability to destroy most life on this planet remains mind-numbingly present and, because we\'ve never experienced anything like it, all too hard to grasp.\nAmong other things, the massive smoke cloud that even a relatively modest if such a word can be used in this context nuclear exchange between, say, India and Pakistan would put into the atmosphere could result in a global "nuclear winter" in which billions of people would starve to death. A larger-scale nuclear conflict might even lead to a "nuclear little ice age" that could last thousands yes, thousands! of devastating years.\n(Note: You can view every article as one long page if you sign up as an Advocate Member, or higher).',

        "text": "The climate is changing, but is the change cause for concern?\n“There are natural climate cycles, which are normal,” research scientist Roy Spencer says, adding that “If you move beyond the temperature to things like storminess, you know, hurricane activity, there have been no demonstrable, long-term changes in anything other than a modest, relatively benign increase in temperature.”\nWhen it comes to climate change, Spencer, a meteorologist and research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says he’s “been hearing the rhetoric and the fearmongering since the 1970s.”\nAsked if he personally worries about climate change, Spencer says: “No, if I was seriously worried about it, you know, I’d be worried for my children’s future and my grandchildren’s future. And I’m not.”\n“I’m more worried about what our government is doing on a number of fronts, including regulatory mandates, which is going to make life much more expensive for them and therefore reduce their standard of living,” adds Spencer, who has researched climate change for 40 years.\nThe “natural fluctuations in weather are normal,” argues Spencer, currently a visiting fellow in The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment. (The Daily Signal is Heritage’s news outlet.)\nSpencer joins “The Daily Signal Podcast” for the final episode of a three-part series on climate change. In it, he explains what we know and don’t know about the root causes of climate change and the appropriate response to a changing climate. Spencer also provides insight into how the climate may change in coming years.\nListen to the podcast below:\nHave an opinion about this article?

        "text": "Although the city of Camas’ Everett Street improvement project likely won’t be fully completed until well into the 2040s or even the 2050s, there is no doubt that a good cross-section of Camasonians are already interested in how city staff and officials can help make this two-lane corridor, which leads traffic past Lacamas and Round lakes toward Camas High School, the city’s North Shore and Camas’ northern boundaries, safer not just for drivers but also pedestrians, bicyclists and others traveling through the area.\nAnd while the City still needs to alleviate many of the concerns of the corridor’s small business owners and residents, the proposed alternative presented to Camas officials in late December seems to have taken seriously the safety concerns of all corridor users.\nThe model includes several “mini roundabouts” throughout the corridor, which will likely prove a safer option for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians traveling to and from the lakes, high school or the parks and open spaces the City plans to include in the still-developing North Shore area.\nAccording to a report by the Iowa Department of Transportation, which used data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), not only are roundabouts — including the small type planned for the Everett Street Corridor — safer people traveling in vehicles, with a 76% reduction in injury crashes compared to lighted intersections, but they’re substantially safer for pedestrians (with a 30% to 40% reduction in pedestrian crashes) and bicyclists (10% reduction in bicycle crashes).\nThe Everett Street preferred design also includes sidewalks on both sides of the road and bicycle lanes separated from the sidewalks by a landscaping buffer and from the vehicle lanes by a raised curb.\nKeeping pedestrians and bicyclists safe in the corridor was something Camas community members who showed up for the city’s Everett Street Corridor open houses and who filled out related surveys said they wanted.\nIn fact, Camas Public Works Director Steve Wall said last summer that the surveys showed the community’s desire for the corridor to include bicycle-pedestrian lanes that would be safe not only for serious bicyclists but also those who are casual cyclists and perhaps not as comfortable riding right beside vehicles.\nImproving our traffic corridors and providing accessible, safe modes of travel for all residents and visitor — not just those behind the wheel of a car, SUV or truck — is critical to fighting climate change, creating a more livable environment for all ages and turning around the recent increase in traffic, bicycle and pedestrian fatalities in our region.\nAs the Willamette Week reported just last week, 2023 was “the deadliest year for Portland traffic accidents in three decades” despite the Portland Police Bureau’s reinstatement of its traffic division in the summer of 2023. In August, 2023, a Multnomah County, Oregon, report found that the increase in traffic fatalities in the Portland metro region is “a significant public health threat” and found that some groups, including Black, Indigenous and other people of color, young people ages 5 to 24, older people over the age of 65, unhoused people and lower-income residents, were at greater risk of dying in a traffic-related incident.\nAlso last month, the Washington State Department of Transportation released a report showing that serious crashes and fatalities on Washington’s roads have increased by 63% since 2013.\nAnd NPR reported in November 2023, that “pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. have been climbing steadily, to their highest level in more than 40 years … jumping more than 80% since 2009.”\nOne reason for the increase in pedestrian deaths, according to research noted by NPR, is an influx of bigger, heavier, taller trucks and SUVs.\n“The new research adds to growing evidence that bigger vehicles are an important factor in pedestrian fatalities,” NPR noted, adding that researchers at the IIHS had found that “pickup trucks, SUVs and vans with a hood height greater than 40 inches are 45% more likely to cause fatalities than shorter vehicles with a hood height of 30 inches or less” and that “among medium-height vehicles with a hood height of between 30 and 40 inches, vehicles with a blunt front profile were 26 percent more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities than those with sloped fronts.”\nThat article noted that the average passenger vehicle in the United States has, over the past 30 years, “gotten about 4 inches wider, 10 inches longer, 8 inches taller and 1,000 pounds heavier.”\nUntil there is pressure on auto manufacturers to create smaller, safer vehicles — and less demand from consumers who want to drive bigger and bigger vehicles — we will need to plan transportation corridors that can accommodate these types of oversized vehicles while still keeping bicyclists and pedestrians safe and separated by more than just a line of paint.\nAs David Harkey, the president of IIHS, told NPR in November, “We really need to think holistically about what we need to do to protect everybody on our roadways — not just those in the vehicle, but those outside the vehicle as well.”\nThe city of Camas is attempting to do just that with their Everett Street Corridor plans, and we have faith that, as long as city officials don’t intervene too much, seasoned and knowledgeable members of the city’s staff — in particular Camas’ director of public works, Steve Wall, and its engineering manager, Curleigh Carothers — will, in conjunction with experienced consultant teams, be able to figure out parking concerns and ease small business owners’ worries without compromising the corridor’s future safety for all Everett Street travelers.",

        "text": "Pacific Whale Foundation calls for 8th Annual World Whale Film Festival submissions\nPacific Whale Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect the ocean and its wildlife, invites passionate filmmakers and artists to honor World Ocean Day 2024 with submissions for the 8th Annual World Whale Film Festival.\nThe fundraiser inspires action by showcasing impactful films by powerful storytellers from around the globe. The hybrid-style film festival begins on June 6, 2024 in Maui, Hawaii with an in-person celebration at OCEAN Organic Farm & Distillery and starts online on World Ocean Day, June 8, and runs through July 31, 2024.\nThe World Whale Film Festival works to raise awareness about the ocean, marine wildlife conservation, Indigenous ecological knowledge, environmental stewardship, and solutions for the ocean and humankind. After the devastating Maui wildfires in August of 2023, the 8th WWFF will honor victims by adding another category of awareness for climate change and natural disasters to showcase the impact of events like the Maui fires on the natural world.\nWWFF was established in 2017 by PWF’s late founder Greg Kaufman and his wife and award-winning PWF documentarian, Selket Kaufman. The festival has made an immense impact on ocean awareness and environmental activism over the last several years.\nPacific Whale Foundation thanked sponsors, the County of Maui and the County of Maui Office of Economic Development for their contribution to the 8th WWFF.\nFilm submissions\nPacific Whale Foundation is seeking dynamic storytelling about the ocean from people of all backgrounds, ages and skill levels. PWF supports ethical visual storytelling that accurately depicts various cultures, ecosystems, and wildlife. Filmmakers must guarantee that the welfare of all marine wildlife and the marine environment was respected and remained undisturbed during filming, as well that they abided by all federal, state and regional regulations on location.\nFilm entries will be considered based on originality, storytelling and technical excellence, artistic merit and overall impact. With each submission, participants must include detailed information such as a film overview, director’s name, biography, email, and photo, web links to affiliate environmental organizations, and the film poster. These details must be shared directly to FilmFreeway: pacificwhale.org/filmfest.\nUpon selection of the film, the winner will have until April 15, 2024, to send PWF the required materials.\nBy entering WWFF 2024, filmmakers acknowledge that the visual content submitted is their own creative work, and does not, to their knowledge, infringe on the rights of any other person and/or business.\nARTWORK/POSTER SUBMISSIONS\nPWF is holding an art contest for artwork to be featured as the 2024 Film Festival Poster. Artwork should incorporate marine wildlife and/or one or more of the five threats they are facing (climate change, vessel collisions, bycatch (fisheries interactions), marine plastic pollution, and unsustainable tourism). Entries are open from Dec. 15, 2023 through Jan. 10, 2024. The winner will be announced on Jan. 15, 2024. Enter Pacific Whale Foundation’s art contest: pacificwhale.org/postercontest.\nA $20 donation benefiting Pacific Whale Foundation is suggested upon submission. There is no limit to the number of entries per person. The winner will have their artwork featured as the poster for the 8th Annual World Whale Film Festival. The poster will be used as the T-shirt design and on other promotional materials for the event. The winner will receive a free Film Festival T-shirt showcasing their design and a free Guide membership for a year.\nFor more information about World Whale Film Festival and full film submission guidelines, visit https://filmfreeway.com/WorldWhaleFilmFestival.",

        "text": "In 2023, wolverines won federal protections, gray wolves were reintroduced in Colorado and the Bureau of Land Management announced a draft-management plan for critical Gunnison sage grouse habitat, all species protected under a statute passed by Congress 50 years ago.\nVera Smith, senior federal lands policy analyst for Defenders of Wildlife, said while the primary goal is to avoid Endangered Species Act listings altogether, when scientists do see species in decline, the act is critical for ensuring they get the protections they need to survive and thrive in the future.\n“The act is really good at incentivizing that,” Smith pointed out. “When species are getting closer to extinction, the act steps in and offers that critical protection and directs resources where they need to go.”\nSince the 1900s, the Gunnison sage grouse has lost 90% of its sagebrush-sea habitat to human development. Smith said the number of birds known for their iconic mating dance has dropped to just 4,000. The BLM manages 42% of the bird’s remaining habitat, and is accepting public comments on its proposal through Feb. 7.\nAfter 20 years of work by conservationists, in November the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to list wolverines as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Fur trapping and poisoning brought the animal to the brink of extinction, and just 300 remain in the lower 48.\nAndrea Zaccardi, carnivore conservation program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said climate change and human disturbance are the two main threats.\n“Wolverines need high elevation, large snowpack levels for their denning habitat,” Zaccardi explained. “Climate change obviously is reducing the availability of the heavy snowpack in high elevations that wolverines need.”\nRyan Sedgeley, southern Rockies field representative for the Endangered Species Coalition, credited the Endangered Species Act for helping gray wolves rebound from near-total extinction in parts of the Northern Rockies and other states. After Colorado voters approved their reintroduction in 2020, 10 wolves were released this December.\n“Wolves haven’t been in Colorado since the 1940s when they were systematically eradicated,” Sedgeley noted. “Restoring the balance to nature, to our ecosystems, is really important.”",

        "text": "ROME — Predicting the future is a bit like what Bob Dole once derisively said of the vice presidency, explaining why he thought it was an easy gig: “It’s indoor work, and there’s no heavy lifting.”\nThe thing about forecasts of the future is that they can’t possibly be wrong at the time you utter them, and by the time the moment of truth actually arrives, you can always hope people will have forgotten whatever you said in advance.\nIn that spirit, here are four storylines to watch for Pope Francis in 2024.\nThis isn’t exactly a crystal ball exercise, since we’re not predicting quite what will happen, simply that these will be important trends to track — but even so, “caveat emptor” still applies, because with the notoriously unpredictable Francis, it’s entirely possible that some bolt from the blue will emerge as the year’s real story.\nPapal health\nAs 2023 came to a close, Francis was once again showing remarkable resilience, exhibiting steady improvement from a bout of severe bronchitis that forced him to cancel a planned Dec. 1-3 trip to Cairo for the COP-28 climate change summit.\nNonetheless, the year also closed with a reminder of the pontiff’s mortality, as he revealed in a recent interview that he’s already made plans for his funeral and burial, including his intention to be entombed in Rome’s Basilica of St. Mary Major.\nLast year was a year in which the pope was hospitalized three times, including once for an abdominal operation related to diverticular stenosis of the colon. (As a footnote, the pontiff may be slightly alarmed right now in light of Italian media reports this week that the surgeon who performed the operation, Sergio Alfieri of Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, is under investigation for allegedly taking credit for surgeries performed by others — though, of course, not the one on the pope.)\nFrancis also continues to suffer from sciatica, the nerve condition that makes it painful for him to stand for very long, and arthritic pain in the knee that’s often confined him to a wheelchair.\nNone of that is life-threatening, and in that recent interview the pope insisted that he feels basically fine and has no present thought of resigning.\nEven after his 87th birthday on Dec. 17, he’s still the oldest reigning pope in the last 120 years, and the combination of age and accumulated health struggles means that his physical capacity is destined to be among the storylines to watch throughout all of 2024.\nTravel\nAlso in that interview with the Mexican TV outlet N+, Francis acknowledged that his physical limits mean his international trips have to be “rethought,” but also seemed to suggest he doesn’t plan to abandon them altogether.\n“We will see how things turn out, but over time I’m going to get back to things,” he told journalist Valentina Alazraki.\nIn concrete, the pope said there’s already a trip to Belgium scheduled for this year. He didn’t specify when, though reports suggest it’s likely to be late September to mark the 600th anniversary of the Catholic universities of Leuven and Louvain. He also said a voyage to Polynesia is “pending,” as is a long-awaited and oft-delayed homecoming trip to his native Argentina.\nSome observers thought the odds of such an outing diminished with the recent election of new Argentine President Javier Milei, who at various points called the pope an “imbecile,” a “Communist,” and a “representative of evil,” but Francis appeared to brush off such rhetoric, saying what matters isn’t what a candidate says on the campaign trail, but what that person does once he or she is in office.\nHere’s one prediction, with a caution: If Francis does go back to Argentina in this year, comparisons will abound to the seven homecoming trips of St. Pope John Paul II to Poland — and, in a reminder not to be carried away by papal health scares, at least four or five of those trips were widely described as his “final” return, given expectations of his imminent demise.\nNow for the caution: Such comparisons will be an apples-and-oranges exercise. Francis probably won’t draw the crowds John Paul did in Poland, and he won’t elicit the same reverential awe. But of course, John Paul started visiting Poland when it was still suffering under a Soviet dictatorship, and his role in national liberation made him a hero. Argentina hasn’t had the same experience, and thus it isn’t fair to expect Francis to stir the same response.\nThe synod and synodality\nWhen the first edition of Francis’ Synod of Bishops on Synodality wrapped up in October, some observers considered it something of a dud, largely because it failed to produce any breakthroughs on contentious issues such as women, homosexuality, and authority in the Church. One Spanish media outlet styled it, tongue-in-cheek, as the “decaffeinated” synod.\nAt the time, however, participants and spokespersons explained the lack of concrete results in part as a reflection of the two-stage nature of the process. The summit this past October, they explained, was merely preparatory for the crescendo with the second synod in October 2024.\nWhat that means is that expectations will be especially high for this October’s synod, even though it’s important to remember that even should the gathering adopt specific recommendations on hot-button issues, it’s still up to Francis himself to make the decisions.\nMore broadly, the synod may well be the best remaining opportunity for Francis to advance his vision of a more synodal Church at all levels, in which the various constituencies in Catholicism — bishops, clergy, religious, and laity — all have a voice. The extent to which Francis is able to move the ball on that vision during 2024, both through the synod and in other ways, inevitably will shape much of the year’s drama.\nU.S./Vatican relations\nLast year was another rocky year in terms of the relationship between the United States and history’s first pope from Latin America.\nOn the one hand, there were clear reminders of the seriousness with which Francis takes the U.S. and that there are Americans who clearly enjoy his trust. In his consistory last September, for example, the pontiff named American Robert Prevost a cardinal in his capacity as prefect of the Vatican’s all-important Dicastery for Bishops, and he also gave a red hat to French Cardinal Christophe Pierre, his envoy to the United States.\nYet there were also high-profile echoes of the tensions that have characterized the American relationship with Francis from the beginning, which reached a climax in November with the removal of Bishop Joseph Strickland from the Diocese of Tyler, Texas, and reports that Francis had decided to strip Cardinal Raymond Burke of his stipend and Vatican-subsidized apartment in Rome.\nOf course, 2024 is an election year in America, and right now it seems at least possible that former President Donald Trump could stage a return to power, potentially auguring a revival of the tensions between the Vatican and the White House that characterized Trump’s first term.\nFamously, for example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was given a cold shoulder during a 2020 visit to Rome after publicly criticizing the pope’s deal with China on the appointment of bishops, saying the Vatican was risking its “moral authority.” In response, Vatican officials made a point of noting that Francis would not receive Pompeo while he was in town.\nAs the election race heats up throughout 2024, the question of the “Catholic vote,” including the extent to which American Catholic bishops, clergy, and laity may take their political cues from the pope, will be much in the air. As a result, managing the inevitable tensions between Rome and the States likely also will be a major storyline throughout the year to come.",

        "text": "Amid America’s fluctuating commitment to green energy, shaped by changing political landscapes and varying state policies, renewable energy often finds itself misrepresented in negative narratives. While some criticisms hold a grain of truth, many are baseless or exaggerated.\nFor example:\nSolar panels don’t work when it’s cloudy — debunked.\nRenewable energy is too expensive — It’s only getting cheaper.\nRenewables require too much land to work efficiently — not true.\nThe list goes on. But since it’s National Bird Day, let’s look at one of the more repetitive claims around our winged friends: Wind turbines kill millions of birds every year, more than fossil fuels. While it’s true that wind turbines do lead to bird fatalities, the scale and impact of these deaths are often overstated and pale in comparison to the threat posed by other human-related activities.\nBased on a series of studies from 2013 and 2014, it’s estimated that between 140,000 and 679,000 birds were killed annually by wind turbines in the U.S. Even though this figure likely underestimates the true extent, as many bird fatalities go undetected, the number is significantly lower than other causes of bird deaths.\nJoel Merriman, the bird-smart wind energy campaign director for the American Bird Conservancy, used wind turbine data from 2021 to extrapolate how many more bird deaths there may have been since the 2013 and 2014 studies. He believes the better average to be around 538,000 deaths per year but says other estimates could place it as high as 1 million.\nSounds like a lot. It’s not.\nCollisions with buildings and attacks by domestic cats account for a much higher number of bird fatalities annually, with estimates reaching up to 988 million and 4 billion, respectively.\nAdditionally, a significant number of birds, ranging from 12 to 64 million each year in the U.S., fall victim to power lines, which, to be fair, are also necessary for transmitting electricity from both wind and other energy sources to consumers.\nWind turbine deaths account for around 0.017% of cat-related bird deaths, while that figure increases slightly to 00.69% for buildings. In contrast, fossil fuel-burning power plants kill about 35 times more birds per gigawatt hour than wind turbines at around 24 million in total.\n“It’s clear that we must act on our shared sense of urgency to reverse the effects of climate change, and that means a rapid shift to clean energy,” said Merriman in a recent article he authored. “But we have to do it right. We can’t throw caution to the wind when it comes to our vulnerable and declining bird populations.”\nBut that’s just generating the power. While it’s challenging to quantify the exact number of bird deaths caused by fossil fuels, the indirect impacts through environmental changes are substantial and far-reaching.\nClearing bayous in Louisiana for petrochemical or liquefied natural gas terminals can also disturb and kill large bird populations. Slicing off the top of hills and mountains to make way for different types of mines also accounts for a large number of deaths.\nAround 1 million birds a year are killed from just ingesting plastic.\nBut more than anything, the rapidly changing climate, mainly driven by fossil fuel consumption, poses a far more significant and long-term threat to birds through habitat destruction, extreme weather events, and ecological shifts.\nAccording to multiple studies, the development of wind energy is part of the solution to saving more birds.\nThe latest wind turbine designs and how they are planned will likely slash the number of bird deaths in the future, according to one report. The simplest way to preserve birds, notes the report, is to ensure that wind farms are in areas away from significant bird habitats and their migratory paths. Boom boxes are another solution, emitting high-frequency sounds that can deter bats and birds. Painting the wind turbines purple is another solution since the insects birds most want to eat are less attracted to that color. New designs, radar, and GPS are also expected to help.",

        "text": "Key Points\n- Sidus Space stock entered into a reversal and is preparing to launch higher.\n- The first LizzieSat will go into orbit in late winter and usher in an age of Space-as-a-service.\n- A license from NOAA paves the way for Space-aaS revenue to begin as early as calendar Q2.\n- 5 stocks we like better than Sidus Space\nThe price action in Sidus Space NASDAQ: SIDU has not been pretty, not until recently, that is. The company was in a sustained downtrend due to its lack of revenue and outlook for risk. However, efforts to get its primary business into gear are gaining traction and setting it up for significant revenue growth in 2024. Because its primary business is Space as a service, the margin is expected to be sky-high and provide a significant lever for cash flow.\nWhat is Sidus Space? Sidus Space is a manufacturing company focused on the space industry. It is headquartered on the Space Coast of Florida, providing hardware solutions to primarily space-related businesses. Today, this company is amid a shift from merely providing hardware to providing space-related hardware as a service. Satellites. Its LizzieSat system is a multi-purpose satellite constellation intended to gather and distribute real-time data for Earth observation and the IoT. The company will also help you design, build and launch your satellite.\nThe first LizzieSat is scheduled for launch in March. It will be followed by several more this year, with accelerating launches in 2025. Because the satellite manufacturing process is a hybrid of traditional and 3-D printing technologies, the company is expected to scale easily as demand for its services grows.\nNOAA validates Sidus Space\nThe rally in Sidus Space stock began before the NOAA announcement but was supercharged by it. What happened is the company received a license from NOAA, paving the way for its operational success. The Tier 1 Remote Sensing License allows Panchromatic and Short Wave imaging to be sold to governments, institutions and businesses. The approval includes the upcoming LizzieSat launch and subsequent launches, removing a major hurdle for the company.\nThe imaging stream will flow through the company’s FeatherBox Artificial Intelligence processor, central to the satellites' design. The system can be used for a wide range of tasks, including monitoring shipping traffic, tracking illegal fishing, methane emissions and the impact of climate change. SpaceX will handle launches; SaaS revenue and income may begin as early as the 2nd calendar quarter of 2024.\nThe sell-side is optimistic about Sidus Space\nThe sell-side is surprisingly optimistic about Sidus Space, given its cash burn and low expectations for 2023 revenue of less than $10 million. There is only one analyst rating the stock tracked by Marketbeat, but the sentiment is bullish, a speculative Buy, that has been affirmed by recent news.\nOn the institutional end of the spectrum, the institutions own more than 20% of the stock and have only bought it for the last two years. Ownership is broad and includes several funds. The top institutional owner is Vanguard Group at just over 1.3%, followed by Geode Capital Management, and both recently made significant increases in their holdings. Insiders own about 56% of the stock.\nThe technical action: Sidus Space prepares for launch\nThe price action in Sidus Space is favorable to reversal. The action hit a low recently and then began to spike on high volume. The volume is partly due to short-covering but marks a significant bottom for the market.\nThe action has since retreated to test and confirm support and is now facing the next hurdle, resistance at $12.00. A sustained rally may form if the market can get above this level. If not, this stock could be range-bound until more news and results confirm the outlook. Among the risks for Sidus Space are capitalization and dilution. The company has been burning through capital at an alarming rate and leaned into dilutive actions to amend the shortfall.\nBefore you consider Sidus Space, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Sidus Space wasn't on the list.\nWhile Sidus Space currently has a \"Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nClick the link below and we'll send you MarketBeat's guide to pot stock investing and which pot companies show the most promise.

        "text": "One of the primary state agencies that oversees Minnesota’s climate and clean energy programs is expanding its staff by nearly two-thirds, fueled by new state and federal funding opportunities.\nThe Minnesota Department of Commerce’s Division of Energy Resources, which plays a central role in Minnesota’s clean energy transition, has added 64 positions to its roughly 90 employees at the start of the year. Of those positions, 42 have been filled and 22 are in the hiring process.\nThe department oversees programs related to energy conservation, solar for schools and colleges, weatherization, energy assistance and other associated areas.\nThe hiring spree is being paid for with new funding from state and federal legislation. The Legislature created seven new energy-related programs this past spring, including rebate efforts, a $100 million state competitiveness fund and a green bank. The Division of Energy Resources will manage the new programs, which are expected to begin this year.\n“We anticipate that as various programs are set up, we may need additional staffing to support those efforts,” said Michelle Gransee, a deputy commissioner who oversees the division.\nSome of the new hires are already helping bring in additional federal dollars to the state. Since July, the division has secured over hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding for utilities and communities under the Inflation Reduction Act and other programs.\n“Bringing in hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, requires dedicated staffing,” Gransee said.\nEmployees will fill out new and existing roles after a department restructuring that added new sections to deal with responsibilities created by lawmakers in the 2023 session, the most productive for energy legislation in Minnesota history. Other hires will assist in funding that has come through the Inflation Reduction Act and other federal laws.\nThe surge in new employees is the largest Gransee has seen in her 14-year Commerce career. The only comparable period came in 2009 when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funded money for clean energy, but that lasted just two years.\nThe division has been hiring program developers, economists, lawyers, engineers, building science specialists, and grants and contracts experts, to name a few.\n“We’re bringing in a diversity of talent and experience, which we were thrilled to see,” Gransee said.\nThe division has been receiving applications from employees of other state agencies, as well as recent University of Minnesota graduates, and people with backgrounds in nonprofits, utilities, and think tanks. The state has used LinkedIn and other regional and national experts to cast a net beyond Minnesota. Many applicants, she said, have been attracted to working at Commerce because they can have a direct impact on mitigating climate change in the state.\nAmong the recent higher profile hires have been Pete Klein, former vice president of finance at the St. Paul Port Authority, who planned to retire before being offered the opportunity to lead the department’s Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority. With a budget of $45 million, the climate innovation authority, also known as a green bank, will develop financing tools to leverage private investment.\nThe department also recently hired John Michael-Cross, formerly a project manager with the Washington, D.C.-based Environment and Energy Study Institute, to run the state’s community solar program. In 2023, the Legislature moved management of the program from Xcel Energy to the state division.\nGransee said not all new employees will be permanent. Several will work under contract and not become employees.\n“The tradition of coming into the state and working for the next 40 years for it isn’t for everybody,” she said. “For some, it’s exciting to come into a position that’s two or three years long, have a great impact, and then see what’s next.”\nThe Division of Energy Resources has recently expanded with more than 30 new programs that will be managed by the following offices:\n- The Office of Energy Affordability combines weatherization assistance and energy assistance programs.\n- The Office of Energy Development includes state energy programs, environmental review, contracting, technical assistance and new units to deploy clean energy programs and pursue additional federal dollars. Since July, this unit has successfully secured over $620 million in new funding for Minnesota utilities and communities.\n- The Office of Regulatory Affairs will continue to conduct regulatory planning and analysis and advocate on behalf of the public interest in front of the Public Utilities Commission and manage the state’s Energy Conservation Optimization Program (formerly the Conservation Improvement Program).\n- The Office of Energy Reliability and Security will help ensure the state has a safe and dependable transmission system.\n“Each of those offices has some growth in them,” she said. “Some are entire units; others will have just one additional person coming into a space for a specific project or program.”\nGregg Mast, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, said the additional employees will be needed to have “rapid rollout of the new programs so we can have swift implementation.” The advocacy group hopes Commerce’s new staff members will expand private sector clean energy jobs in Minnesota.\nSince the legislative session ended, Gransee said agency staff have been occupied with creating new and updating existing programs.\n“We’re thrilled by the expansion,” she said. “We could have twice as many staff and still keep everybody busy.”\nThis article first appeared on Energy News Network and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.",

(OSV News/Reuters/Esa Alexander)\nWant some good news?\nThe Archdiocese of Chicago announced on Dec. 17 that its nearly 400 parishes, schools, cemeteries and offices will switch to 100% renewable energy for electricity needs beginning Jan. 1.\nThis covers about 2,000 buildings and is the equivalent of removing 15,000 cars from the road annually.\nIn his announcement, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich said the action was taken "as an expression of our commitment to the sanctity of life."\nIt was part of an attempt, he said, "to ensure generations to come have a future."\nThink of what we could do for the climate as Catholics if we all advocated for this kind of change. What Chicago\'s decision says to me is that there is something we can do about this crisis, and one powerful way to help is by an institutional commitment. And what better institution to lead the charge than our church?\nIn another piece of good news from Chicago, the University of St. Mary of the Lake at Mundelein boasts the only solar installation at a U.S. seminary. Okay, the fact that it\'s the only one isn\'t part of the good news, but let\'s focus on the positive.\nFr. John Kartje, rector/president of the seminary, said his seminarians are from 25 dioceses in the U.S. and abroad. Together, they will "carry the commitment to good stewardship of the earth with them."\nAccording to a CNN survey nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults say they are worried about the threat of climate change in their communities. According to the poll, 73% of U.S. adults say "the federal government should develop its climate policies" to cut the country\'s planet-warming pollution in half by the end of the decade.\nIn a divided country, that\'s a lot of agreement. Good news.\nAdvertisement\nAs Pope Francis has reminded us, our whole ecosystem is challenged, almost to the point of no return. The pope, in his 2015 encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si\', spoke of our relationships: with God, our neighbor and the earth itself, all of whom are intimately connected.\nIn his 2023 follow-up, Laudate Deum, the pope said our responses have not been adequate and that "the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point."\nBut here\'s another piece of good news, something positive we can all do. In 2006, the U.S. bishops, along with other groups, founded Catholic Climate Covenant. This nonprofit offers a pledge you can take, and what better New Year\'s resolution to make than a commitment to our common home? At their website, catholicclimatecovenant.org, you can take the pledge, selecting the things you feel you can do, saying "no" to those that are too challenging right now.\nYou can also add your own commitments. Mine, for instance, involves enrolling in a program in which I collect my food scraps — peels, pits, coffee grounds, filters, paper plates — which are picked up by a local company that composts them, keeping them out of the landfill, where they would contribute to greenhouse gasses. It\'s a few dollars a month for a great cause.\nRemember "Bill Nye the Science Guy?" Here\'s some good, positive advice I heard from this science educator the other day. Recycling is fine, he said, but for real change, there are two things we must do.\nWe should be "talking about climate change" just as much as we talk about other major issues. And we should vote with climate in mind.\nShare the good news with your parish, your diocese, your legislators. If we\'re serious about saving our world for our grandchildren, let\'s make some noise.',

        "text": "The sun finished setting a couple hours ago on what turned out to be yet another green Christmas for most of the Northeast as I wrote this. Despite this, I’m not writing about global warming or climate change. According to the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) division of the National Weather Service (NWS), during this autumn, for the first time in four years, an El Niño assumed climate center stage, heading into winter 2023-24. That El Niño event drives the outlook for warmer-than-average temperatures for the northern tier of the continental U.S., according to CPC.\nThat division of the NWS released its winter outlook for the U.S. on Oct. 19. The agency’s forecasters project a 75% – 85% chance that we will see a “strong” El Niño throughout winter. There is even a 30% chance that this will exceed a 2.0º C increase during the winter just beginning. Climate scientists said such an occurrence would put ocean temperatures on a par with some of the strongest El Niños on record. The report predicts drier-than-average conditions across the northern U.S., especially in the High Plains and near the Great Lakes.\nEl Niño events are indicated by sea surface temperature (SST) increases of more than 0.9º F (0.5º C) for at least five successive three-month spans. (A strong El Niño is defined as surpassing a 1.0º C increase.) This SST is measured in the east-central region of the equatorial Pacific. The baseline for these comparisons is what average SST would be for that location at that time of year during the preceding five-year period.\nAccording to CPC, El Niño events usually include drier-than-normal conditions “common in western New York and Pennsylvania. As storms often move up the coast during El Niño winters, the Eastern Seaboard generally experiences above-normal precipitation.”\nAccording to a spokesperson from the Global Resilience Institute, “During an El Niño pattern, winter season means the chances for warmer-than-average temperatures across the northern states increase while conditions in the Northeast will be wetter than in the West and Midwest. But that doesn’t mean people in New England and other northern states should keep their snow shovels in storage. In places like Boston or the Northeast in general, just because temperatures will be warmer in general doesn’t mean we will not have one or two fairly intense snowstorms.”\nWith the idea that winter will, at some point, really behave like winter, here are some feeding management pointers geared to finding a good spot for lower quality roughages in the diets of ruminants:\nDue to a fairly widespread dry spell during May/June 2023, first cutting yields in the Northeast were commonly less than hoped for. Therefore, many meadows that hadn’t been harvested at all in 2022 were baled during summer 2023. This type of hay often earns the title “heifer hay” or “dry cow hay” (described as “at least better than snowballs”).\nThe organic hay situation is something I monitor closely. There’s a lot of hay that’s certified organic, but it’s organic by default. This means that the grower didn’t feed the soil any forbidden inputs, because that person didn’t feed the soil anything! Animals fed that kind of hay are generally voracious mineral consumers, rarely performing well on that forage.\nThe lack of high-quality roughages in the Northeast often forces local hay-deficient farmers to shop for far-away forages grown on deep well-irrigated meadows in the West. These hay sellers consistently test their feeds so that the buyer knows what they’re purchasing. Once the hay arrives at the end of its 1,500- or 2,000-mile journey, its new owners can do their own analysis and compare those results to what the seller sent in advance of the shipment. From what I’ve seen, very few local hay growers are testing the forages that they’re selling to nearby farmers.\nSo how can we best utilize this less-than-perfect hay crop? Winter itself can answer that question. A major benefit of cold weather is that extra fibrous feeds tend to be more palatable to (or at least more appreciated by) otherwise shivering ruminants. During extreme cold, cattle owners often complain that animals are guzzling down forages at higher rates than they had planned on. I tell them that during really cold weather these bovines – in addition to producing milk – are mobile furnaces.\nCold weather is the best time to feed more fibrous (hence lower energy) roughage to ruminants. My logic here is that if they can generate more body warmth from digesting this fiber, this will lower the extent to which they must tap into energy otherwise destined for milk production.\nI’ll now address the body-warming aspects of lower-quality feeds.\nCornell Animal Science Professor F.B. Morrison discussed heat increment in his 1959 edition of “Morrison’s Feeds and Feeding.” He wrote that it’s easy to envision the energy jaws require to chew food. But less visible are the workings of digestive juices, plus the increased work of the heart and lungs during the dynamic process called rumination. Let me quote that scientist:\n“There are losses of energy through the heat produced through the bacterial action upon carbohydrates. The energy expended in all these procedures takes the form of heat, and it may help to warm the body, if sufficient heat is not being produced elsewhere in the body.”\nMorrison also wrote that a speeding up of the body processes takes place, a development which always follows the ingestion and digestion of food. At the peak of this digestive activity, more heat is produced than at other times, an event which occurs in all animals, especially ruminants. When humans are chilly and eat something, we soon feel noticeably warmer. If we eat too much in hot weather, we suffer even more from heat. Scientists refer to this energy liberation in ruminants as heat increment, which is a plus in cold weather – and more of a liability in hot weather.",

        "text": "Micro Mama’s, located in Weare, NH, is a successful producer of lacto-fermented vegetables. They are passionate about paving the way for the future of agriculture. On Dec. 19, Stephanie Zydenbos, owner of Micro Mama’s, hosted a special event featuring Xochitl Torres Small, the Deputy Secretary of USDA.\nTorres Small used her time at the event to hear attendees speak, posing the questions “How do we use [money from the USDA] to support small farms? How do we use that money to support resiliency?”\nOverall, a main concern brought up was that some programs are hard for farmers to access, especially if they don’t have their own grant writer. Additionally, a lot of programs aren’t made for specialty crops or small farmers, leaving those farmers to fend for themselves.\nThe Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) was instituted specifically for small local farmers. Torres Small reflected how “President Biden was very clear that we had to use [REAP] to drive down energy costs to support small, local farmers and to make sure that we are also fighting climate change.”\nAt the end of the day, small farms are not going to out-compete large producers through efficiency or produce the cheapest products in the industry. Bruce Wooster, from Piccadilly Farm, mentioned how it’s difficult for local producers to compete with larger farms and how “it’s much more possible to get a head of lettuce from Arizona than it is from Winchester [New Hampshire] if you are buying in Concord [New Hampshire].”\nHowever, “what [small farms] may do is be able to show the value that you are putting into the land and the soil, showing the investment you’re making when it comes to organic and climate-smart processes that a customer is looking for,” Torres Small noted.\nFood Solutions New England has a goal to produce 50% of all food for New Englanders by 2060. In order to reach this ambitious goal, farmers have to spread the word about the value of their products.\n“Our farmers are not only growing our food, they are stewarding and preserving our lands, and we should be investing in them as a community,” commented an attendee of the event.\nOverall, REAP will help small farms in New Hampshire, and the rest of the U.S., keep up with the growing population, compete with the larger producers in their own way and help get New England to the goal of producing 50% of its own food intake.\nFor more information on what REAP has to offer, visit rd.usda.gov/programs-services/energy-programs/rural-energy-america-program-renewable-energy-systems-energy-efficiency-improvement-guaranteed-loans.\nby Kelsi Devolve",

        "text": "APTOS — All week long, the scene at local beaches has caused visitors to pause for a moment and stand in awe of what sits before them while their furry companions are sent into an insuppressible fit of joy.\nThat’s right, there’s still plenty of driftwood piled up on Santa Cruz County shores – parked there last week by heavy rainfall and a massive tidal swell.\nThe images aren’t so different from last January, when a powerful string of atmospheric river storms swept mountains of ocean debris and tree trunks the size of SUVs onto local shores that took officials weeks to clean up and disperse.\nBut as crews rung in the new year with another robust mop up effort to the dismay of countless local pups, some may wonder: where does it all come from and where does it end up?\nAnother pileup\nGabe McKenna, spokesperson for California State Parks which manages nine beaches across the county and several more subunit regions, said the cleanup effort in some of the hardest-hit, low-lying areas such as Seacliff, Rio Del Mar and New Brighton began Tuesday and will continue for at least a week.\nBeaches in Capitola and Santa Cruz were also inundated with a mix of seaweed, tree branches and large timber during the heavy storms in late December.\nAccording to McKenna, the pileup is likely explained by three factors: high tides coupled with pounding waves pushed water to places that hadn’t been touched since last winter, jostling debris beached in previous storms; additional sticks and rocks nestled in the sand were unearthed by that same rushing water; and rainfall created enough runoff that carried some debris from rivers and creaks into the ocean that was then brought back ashore.\n“It is a natural process; it does happen every single winter,” said McKenna. “This time seems to be coupled with that last swell event … the inundation was greater at Seacliff so it got additional damage and additional debris.”\nWorkers are sifting through the material – separating the big and small – and early estimates are that 85% of it is organic including pebbles, rocks and driftwood, according to McKenna. He added that nearly all of the organic material on state beaches will be redistributed back onto the beach, while some of the larger logs will be removed and sent through a wood chipper and then used as ground cover in other park regions. The inorganic material such as asphalt, concrete or pressure-treated wood will be hauled to the landfill.\nAs of Thursday, McKenna had no estimate for how much the cleanup effort from this latest storm will cost.\nMcKenna said the day-use and campground area that endured extensive damage in early January of last year was shuttered Tuesday after some of the repair work was further eroded.\n“Taking a little bit of a step backwards here,” he lamented.\nMcKenna said Thursday that pedestrian and vehicle access will be fully restored to lower Seacliff and the Rio Del Mar Platform parking lot by Saturday, but he urged pedestrians to “heed signs and barriers and stay out of damaged areas.”\nMeanwhile, for the beach areas that are open, State Parks will permit the public to remove as much as 50 pounds of driftwood from the beach in a 24-hour window, but tools such as chainsaws are prohibited, McKenna said.\nContext and ecology\nAs McKenna hinted, distinguished professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz Gary Griggs confirmed that Santa Cruz County is no stranger to powerful storms and the surge of debris they churn up.\nGriggs explained that wood, leftover from the logging industry or dropped into local streams through wind activity or erosion, has historically been carried to the ocean courtesy of the San Lorenzo River as well as Soquel and Aptos creeks during major storm events. After fanning out into the bay, the powerful tide then sweeps them onto local beaches.\nAccording to Griggs, debris flows piled up at local bridges and blanketed the shoreline after major winter storms in 1955, 1982, 2013, 2016-17 and 2023, to name just a few.\n“Some of the stuff that probably gets remobilized was on the back of the beach from an earlier year,” said Griggs. “To a small degree, some of the debris comes off the bluffs.”\nOne local official with a close eye on the county’s rivers and streams is Erin McCarthy, water resources planner with the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency. McCarthy manages the county’s stream wood program, which enforces a policy that large wood should be left in place when it enters local streams and rivers unless it poses and imminent threat to property, infrastructure, safety or habitat.\nMcCarthy said last year was a banner year when it came to reports of stream wood issues, with more than a 100 total calls when somewhere between seven and 20 would be considered normal.\n“I was expecting to get calls during the last couple of weeks when we were having higher flows and I didn’t,” said McCarthy. “I think a lot of the wood that was loose in the watershed that was ready to be mobilized and enter our waterways, I think a lot of that already happened last year. That’s just my guess.”\nMcCarthy took a moment to highlight that stable stream wood, or large woody material, in the county’s rivers and streams often helps provide critical habitat for wildlife in the area, supports channels and banks and promotes groundwater recharge.\nSteelhead and coho salmon in the county – both protected by the Endangered Species Act – rely on the pools formed by stream wood as a safe haven during treacherous high flow periods and a place to lay their eggs.\n“It creates habitat complexity in our watersheds,” said McCarthy, adding that it’s “always a balance” when it comes to maintaining its important role for local wildlife while avoiding pitfalls such as major blockages or flooding.\nClimate projections\nBut for the logs and sticks that have taken the tumultuous journey downstream and settled on the beach, Griggs said the ecological benefits they provide are likely a wash and the ultimate fate of the water-logged wood is likely not too consequential.\n“My overall sense is: While there’s some modest ecological benefit, I don’t think that’s a make- or break-it situation for how we deal with it,” he said.\nAnd while crews will continue the clean up effort until the piles have dissipated, the ever-increasing threat of climate change is likely to bring them back sooner than later. Griggs said current evidence and climate models point to longer, hotter, drier summers followed by more concentrated rainfall in the winter months. This equation, he added, is likely to produce more slope instability and higher stream flows.\n“These floods are going to get more common and probably bring more debris to the shoreline,” said Griggs. “That’s what climate change projections would tell us.”",

        "text": "Nick Garcia\nRodriguez went from political unknown to a step away from being governor in just three years.\nWith the elections for president and U.S. Senate exactly one year away, the Wisconsin Democratic Party dispatched its most prominent suburban mom — Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez — to talk to the Wisconsin voters who will decide who wins those elections.\nOver the Nov. 4-5 weekend, in small rallies in Kenosha, Ozaukee and Dane counties, Rodriguez echoed President Joe Biden’s call to “finish the job” by re-electing the president, Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\nDemocrats in Wisconsin and Washington want “safe schools,” she said, “full funding” of public schools, “sensible” gun-control laws, clean water and action to slow climate change. “Our values are Wisconsin values. We’re not creating chaos in Washington. Democrats are trying to get things done.”\nWhy should suburban moms, who play increasingly important roles in elections, listen to her?\nAs the mother of 17- and 14-year-olds (“lots of eye-rolling and door slamming in my house”) who attend a public Waukesha high school, Rodriguez says she knows what issues matter to people, regardless of party affiliation. “I have the privilege of being able to talk to people all over the political spectrum. We agree on 85-90% of things that are important to Democrats.”\nIn 2020, she adds, “We flipped [an Assembly] district in Waukesha County, which is not exactly a bastion of liberalism.... We can flip a district anywhere in the state.”\nOn weekends, the 48-year-old Rodriguez plays the role of Democratic Party messenger. On weekdays, she serves as an ambassador for Evers, either by traveling the state or working out of her first-floor Capitol office. Her schedule is dictated by aides to the governor, and she visited all 72 counties in 2023.\n“They tell me where to go,” Rodriguez joked to a class of seventh graders from Waukesha County who visited her at her office in early December.\nBut who is Sara Rodriguez, who went from political unknown to a step away from being governor in just three years? She advises Evers on health care and other issues that the governor has prioritized. But like other lieutenant governors before her, she plays a supporting role.\n“I will always be a nurse until the day I die,” says Rodriguez. “Being a nurse was the best decision I ever made in my entire life.”\nAfter graduating from Brookfield East High School, Rodriguez earned bachelor’s degrees in nursing and neuroscience, and master’s degrees in public health and nursing.\nRodriguez was a nurse in Samoa for the Peace Corps, working as a health-care educator in villages with HIV/AIDS patients. As an epidemic intelligence officer for the Centers for Disease Control, she slept on a Navy ship while helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane Katrina. She worked for a three-county health network around Denver before she became the chronic disease director for the state of Colorado.\nThen her mom called: Your dad, she told her, was “acting a little funny.”\n“I could tell he was having memory issues,” Rodriguez says of her dad, a Vietnam war vet then in his 60s. “I knew my mom was going to need help.”\nThe nurse and her family — husband, Baltazar, a native of Mexico and an IT network engineer who she met in an Oklahoma salsa dancing class, and their two children — moved back to Waukesha County in 2011. Her parents moved in with them and together they lived with the emotional loss, chaos and pain in Alzheimer’s wake.\nShe feels “lucky” her father was able to live with them until he died. Her mother still lives with them.\nBack in Wisconsin, Rodriguez worked for two giant companies: Honeywell, working on “remote patient monitoring,” and Aurora, as a vice president of population health. That meant working with nurses on patient care management, making sure patients “don’t come back to the emergency department.”\nBut nurse Rodriguez didn’t self-diagnose or take time to be tested for celiac disease, caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. Now gluten-free, she endured its many symptoms until she was 36.\nWhen COVID paralyzed the nation in 2020, sickening and killing millions and closing schools and businesses, Rodriguez was appalled that Wisconsin’s Republican-led Legislature “didn’t meet for eight months — didn’t meet at all.”\n“It was so frustrating to me, as a clinician, as a nurse, somebody who worked in public health…. People wanted us to provide leadership, to listen to the experts and science that was out there.”\nRepublican legislators should have done expanded telehealth services and made sure that state and local health departments had the resources they needed to protect Wisconsin residents, she says.\nShe lived in the 13th Assembly District, a traditionally Republican suburban district that a Democrat came within 955 votes of winning in 2018. That Democrat wasn’t running again. Should Rodriguez run?\n“I didn’t think I was ever going to run for office,” she told the seventh graders having a pizza lunch in her Capitol office. But she saw a lack of knowledge among lawmakers during the COVID crisis: “I know how health care works firsthand.”\nEncouraged by veteran Democratic Rep. Evan Goyke, whose own Assembly district borders the 13th and who knocked on doors for her, Rodriguez decided to take a significant pay cut and run against Republican Rep. Rob Hutton, now a state senator.\nGoyke says he had never heard of Rodriguez when Waukesha County Democrats proposed her as a potential 13th District candidate in 2020. But he was impressed when the two talked. “Sara asked: ‘What was it like to serve in the Legislature?’\n“I liked that a lot,” Goyke says. “I want to work with people that do this on purpose. Sometimes, you meet candidates and they’re just excited to get their name out there. They all believe they have to be in Congress.”\nA total of $1.59 million — “an obscene” amount, Rodriguez now says — was spent in that 2020 Assembly race, with her campaign and third-party groups spending $953,000 of that to elect her. She won by 733 votes, out of 37,901 votes cast.\nIn January 2021 she was sworn into an Assembly controlled by Republicans who don’t take advice from first-term Democrats, even those whose careers were spent in health care.\nBut she was helpful to her Democratic colleagues, advising them on COVID and other public health issues, says Goyke. “In our Democratic caucuses, she was almost an agenda item: ‘What’s new with COVID, Sara?’ She has incredible professional credentials — too good for the Assembly.”\nRodriguez was not naive about the political realities of a Legislature controlled by one party, but nevertheless found it frustrating that she couldn’t make a difference on COVID policy. In her current role, she is free of the constraints of the legislative process and focused on the upcoming elections. Democrats are looking to Rodriguez to fire up voters, especially on social issues like abortion and LGBTQ rights.\n“Republicans in Washington want a ‘national abortion ban,’” Rodriguez warned at those November rallies. “This is a dangerous policy, and it’s not a policy that anyone in Wisconsin wants…. They’re coming for birth control next.”\nBrandon Maly, chair of the Dane County Republican Party, says that Rodriguez is fear-mongering. While some abortion opponents in the Republican Party support federal legislation on abortion, “Our Senate and presidential nominees…will not be individuals that support a national abortion ban.”\n“Rodriguez represents a political minority on most issues,” he adds. “She wants to take away school choice from low-income families and oppose tax cuts for the working class.”\nMaly, who is also actively seeking suburban voters, says Rodriguez “would be wise to do some introspection into her own party and focus back on Wisconsin instead of nationalizing everything. Her boss is the one in many cases sowing chaos and ruling against the will of the people, using the veto as often as he does.”\nBut Goyke says recent events, like the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, have activated women, especially suburban women, toward the Democratic Party and Democratic ideals. And Rodriguez is the perfect messenger for communicating those ideals to voters, he adds: “Sara’s origin story, to me, is a mom, resident, random citizen — not a political person whatsoever.”\nDuring the redistricting process in 2021, Republicans targeted Rodriguez, redrawing the 13th Assembly District and moving thousands of Wauwatosa and West Allis Democratic voters into the districts of Goyke and Democratic Rep. Daniel Riemer. The 13th district is now represented by Republican Rep. Tom Michalski.\n“Sara understood; she’s smart. She could have run, and she would have lost,” Goyke recalls. “I think she ran for lieutenant governor because, in that short time, she got the bug — the political bug.”\nMandela Barnes was running for the U.S. Senate, so there was no incumbent lieutenant governor. Should she run, knowing that she was a political unknown statewide and, if Evers and she won, she’d be a heartbeat away from being governor?\n“I wouldn’t have run for this office if I didn’t think I could fulfill the duties of this office, and [becoming governor if there is a vacancy] is one of them,” Rodriguez says.\nNick Garcia\nNo bigger-name Democrat ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, so Rodriguez easily beat a Hmong community leader, Peng Her, in the August primary. In November, the Evers-Rodriguez ticket defeated Republicans Tim Michels, for governor, and state Sen. Roger Roth, for lieutenant governor.\nVeteran Wisconsin political scientist Charles Franklin, founder of the Marquette University Law School poll, says that lieutenant governors from both parties, not unlike vice presidents, are “largely at the mercy of the executive to give them things to do, or not to do. Sometimes that leaves the lieutenant governor with little role, and they try to create one on their own, which can make for tension with the governor and their staff.\n“Many lieutenant governors have had very little visibility,” he adds. “On the other hand, looking ahead to 2026 and a potential Evers retirement, the lieutenant governor’s role is certainly a potential launching pad.”\nMandela Barnes used that role to lay the groundwork to run for the U.S. Senate, narrowly losing to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, Franklin notes.\n“Certainly Rodriguez has done events on policy issues and elect-Dems rallies are an example of building support with potential future Democratic office holders who might support her in the future.”\nBut, he adds, “The fundamental barrier is the lieutenant governor is not able to take independent action in the same way that the attorney general, for example, can. Or a member of the Legislature. The governor is always a constraint on what the lieutenant governor can do.”\nIf the 72-year-old Evers does not seek a third term, Rodriguez and three other Democratic leaders — Attorney General Josh Kaul, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski and Missy Hughes, CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation — are expected to consider running for governor in 2026.\nWhat has Sara Rodriguez learned in her first year as lieutenant governor — a job one pundit described as a “low-profile, limited-responsibility office”?\nRodriguez bristles at that description. “This office is what you make of it. I can use the microphone that I have to shine a light on things that are important to people in Wisconsin.” Those include Medicaid expansion and addressing the health care workforce shortage.\nShe and Evers talk at least every two weeks. “The governor always makes sure that I know what’s going on, that I am involved in many of these things.” Multiple requests for comment from the governor for this story went unanswered by his communications team.\nAccomplishments?\nRepublican legislators killed one health-care initiative that Rodriguez got Evers to include in his proposed 2023-25 budget. They also killed the goal of expanding Medicaid to 90,000 more low-income Wisconsin residents — 30,000 of whom now have no insurance, Rodriguez laments.\nBut she and the governor started the first in the nation apprenticeship program for nurses, a partnership between UW-Madison and Madison College. Participants “end up with no school debt, and a really good, family-supporting job,” Rodriguez says, vowing to try to expand the program.\nAnd, yes, if it came to that, Sara Rodriguez is ready to become governor.\n“I’m absolutely ready to be governor, if that happens. What I bring to the table is I have been an executive within large organizations for many years. The state of Wisconsin is a very large, complicated organization.”\nWhat does Rodriguez do when she’s not in the Capitol, being a suburban mom, or going around the state firing up Democrats?\nShe loves to hike outdoors, especially on the Ice Age Trail. She played softball — pitcher and shortstop — in her youth, but now enjoys archery: “I don’t shoot at things that move.”\nHer bookshelf in the Capitol might be the only one that includes a guide to tequila. Her husband is a tequila connoisseur, Rodriguez explains. And, yes, Wisconsin’s lieutenant governor drinks tequila.\nAsked if she would run for governor in 2026 if Evers does not seek a third term, Rodriguez is noncommittal.\n“I’m focused on working with Gov. Evers to grow our state’s workforce, protect access to healthcare, and deliver results,” she says.“If Gov. Evers runs for another term, I’ll look forward to running alongside him as lieutenant governor. I’ll always look for opportunities to serve the people of our state.”",

        "text": "On this episode of the Utterly Moderate Podcast we discuss both the pros and cons of nuclear power, especially as it pertains to combatting global climate change.\nThe international community is attempting to keep the world from warming no more than 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century.\nWhile there have been incredible efforts to achieve this—efforts that have likely taken the worst-case warming scenarios off the table—we are still on track for closer to 3.0 degrees warming by 2100 instead of 2.0 degrees.\nPeople are also reading…\nSome would argue that the expansion of nuclear power would go a long way toward closing that gap.\nFriend of this show and frequent guest, The Bulwark’sMona Charen, has written that:\n“The world’s demand for energy is not going to diminish, but only increase in the coming century. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates world energy demand will increase 50% by 2050. . . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] countries cannot in conscience deny development to the world’s poorer nations.

Welcome back to the program. This is the utterly moderate podcast. And I'm your host, Lawrence Eppard. On today's program, we are talking about both the pros and the cons of nuclear power, especially when it comes to tackling climate change. So if this isn't something that you pay a lot of attention to and you're not really familiar with what the international agreements are, basically what countries around the world are trying to do is by the end of this century. We are attempting to keep the world from warming no more than 1.5 to two degrees Celsius above where we were before the Industrial Revolution. And it's pretty amazing how much work has been done in the international community to tackle climate change. It's been pretty amazing. And the worst case scenarios, it looks like, are off the table because of international cooperation. But there's still a lot of work to be done. We're still closer to three degrees of warming rather than two degrees of warming, and we really need to close that gap. And there are many who would argue that nuclear power is one really important tool in our arsenal to help us close that gap. Mona Charon, who you probably know is a frequent guest on this show, and a friend of this podcast. She has written the following about nuclear power quote the world's demand for energy is not going to diminish, but only increase in the coming century. The US. Energy Information Administration estimates world energy demand will increase by 50% by 2050. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries cannot in conscience deny development to the world's poorer nations. Nor can we dilute ourselves that renewables at the current state of technology can take up all the slack created by giving up fossil fuels. Amazingly, there is an existing technology that can produce the energy the world needs without harming the environment. And yet we hesitate. Nuclear power is the key to limiting climate change and hobbling some of the world's worst Aggressors. If we're serious about both problems, we'll clear the air of superstitions about nuclear power. Nuclear power plants cannot explode like nuclear bombs. They require much less land than solar or wind. Nuclear waste can be safely buried. The US. Navy has been powering ships with nuclear reactors since the late 1950s. According to the naval Post us Nuclear powered warships have safely operated for more than 50 years without experiencing any reactor accident or any release of radioactivity that hurt human health or had an adverse effect on marine life. Nothing is perfect. One death from radiation exposure at the Fukushima power plant has been noted by the Japanese government, a worker who died of lung cancer in 2018, seven years after the tsunami and meltdowns. But if we are in a new, hard headed era. We will evaluate trade offs like adults. Are we serious about choking off the source of Putin's power or not? Are we serious about combating climate change without illusions that wind or solar will do the job? Nuclear, power can be a major part of the solution to both challenges. End quote.\nRobert Zubrin has written a new book on nuclear power\nSpeaker B: Our guest today, Robert Zubrin, has written a new book on this topic titled The Case for Nukes, where he argues that, quote, the bottom line is this we are going to need to produce a lot more energy, and it will need to be carbon free. The only way to do that is with nuclear power. In my book, I go into great detail about how nuclear power is generated, new technologies coming online, and what all of this will mean for the future of humanity, including space exploration. End quote. Robert Zubrin, we are so happy to have you on the show today. Thank you so much for joining us.\nSpeaker A: Thanks for inviting me.\nSpeaker B: No problem.\nYou have a new book called The Case for Nukes about global warming\nSpeaker C: So you got a great new book out called The Case for Nukes how We Can Beat Global Warming and Create a Free, open and magnificent Future. So let's start with what's your background? What's your training? What brought you to write this book?\nSpeaker A: Well, I actually have a doctorate in nuclear engineering. I've only worked, a fraction of my career in the nuclear industry. Mostly I've worked aerospace. But, now we have this whole global warming alarm. There are people who are pushing solutions which are basically reactionary, essentially rigging up fuel prices to, deter people of limited income from using fuel or electricity. That's what it amounts to. And, I think that's unethical. And furthermore, it hasn't worked. We've doubled our carbon emissions in the past 30 years, just as we did in the 30 years between 1960 and 1990. We doubled it. We doubled it between 1930 and 1960, and we doubled it between 1990 and then 2020 because people don't want to be poor. And not using fuel essentially amounts to poverty. and the answer is straightforward. It's nuclear power. And, it's very unfortunate that the groups who are, making the greatest alarm about global warming are fighting against nuclear power.\nSpeaker C: All right, so you, propose the answer, at least in terms of a bridge technology, until we do something like fusion or whatever in the future, might solve this problem.\nOne of the disadvantages of nuclear power is it has been made expensive\nSpeaker C: So let's talk about advantages and disadvantages. Let's start with disadvantages, and you can tell me what you make of it. So, one of the disadvantages is it has been expensive to build. Correct?\nSpeaker A: It's been made expensive. the first nuclear power plant we built in this country took three years to build. Now, it takes 16. And, this has been the result of hostile regulation. and if you look at the numbers, and I present them in my book, the Cost to Build a nuclear power plant has gone up precisely in proportion to time squared. Okay? Construction time squared is the cost of the nuclear power plant. Anything can be made, prohibitively costly. If the FAA were run like the NRC, there would be no airlines. If a city government banned parking in the city, they would say it was impossible to park. Or they would say you can only park in places where it's $100 an hour to park. And they say, well, gee, parking costs $100 an hour. Well, you can make anything cost, excessive amounts through regulation. And that's what we've had with nuclear power.\nNuclear power is the only power which has such a small amount of waste\nSpeaker C: Another disadvantage people point to, and I want you to tell me if I'm making too much of it, not enough of it. You give us your take on the problem of nuclear waste. So what's the problem? And do you think it can be overcome?\nSpeaker A: Well, it's ironic that they single out nuclear waste as a problem because nuclear power is the only power which has such a small amount of waste that you actually can store it. The idea of sequestering and storing the waste from coal fired power would be absurd. And of course, fossil fuel in any kind, it sends its waste right into the atmosphere. and the waste products from making photovoltaics are enormous in the way of, ah, fluorine compounds. It caused massive fish kills and damage to public health in China, where these things are made. nuclear power, on the other hand, the amount of waste is, minuscule, and we could reduce it still more by reprocessing the waste. Ah, but of course, the, anti nukes have been first in line to, prevent that. But there's no technical problem with disposing of nuclear waste. The French reprocess and then store their waste. The US. Military, the nuclear navy, stores its waste in salt caverns in New Mexico. the, anti nukes have had no effect on implementing that solution because the Navy needs nuclear submarines and they're just not willing to have their program sabotaged. So the anti nukes have focused on preventing any storage of civilian nuclear waste. And they claim they're interested in safety. How can that be when they are saying, we would prefer to have nuclear waste stored at nuclear power plants in the suburbs of major cities rather than under a mountain in the middle of the desert? Nevada.\nOne of the fears about nuclear waste is the possibility of a meltdown\nSpeaker C: All right, so you say nuclear waste can be solved. You say that, the cost can be brought down with changes to regulation. One of the fears, and I want you to talk about this fear and how we should contextualize it, is, of course, the danger of a meltdown. So tell us, is that a reasonable fear? How should we think about that danger?\nSpeaker A: Okay, meltdowns are possible. That is, while a pressurized water reactor, which is pretty much all the reactors we have in the United States, cannot, have a runaway chain reaction because it needs the water in order to sustain the chain reaction. And if the water boils too much, the reaction shuts down. There is still waste heat left in the reactor, that is from radioactive, waste particles in the fuel. And they continue to give off heat whether the reactor is running or not. And so if the water is gone, you'll have heat and there's no cooling, the fuel will melt down. And the anti nukes said, well, gee, it will melt down. It'll melt down right through the steel pressure vessel, which is eight inches thick, and then through the concrete containment, vessel, which is 8ft thick. we actually had, ah, a meltdown at Three Mile Island. And what happened was the core did melt down and it hit the steel pressure vessel and it melted its way about one inch into the steel, and then it stopped. It didn't penetrate the steel pressure vessel. It never even reached the containment building, let alone China. So this is, a, greatly, overhyped, situation. it is an engineering concern. The Three Mile Island reactor was lost. It was a loss of investment, but there was no harm to the public.\nSpeaker C: One of the examples, people point to is Chernobyl. But, that was very different technology and very different, political and leadership context, right?\nSpeaker A: Correct. Chernobyl was not a pressurized water reactor, as I mentioned. you, see, to make the chain reaction work, you got to slow the neutrons down. It's called moderating the neutrons. They're going too fast. They go right by nuclei without splitting, okay? So you got to slow them down. So we use water to slow down the neutrons. And, the advantage of that is, if the reactor gets too hot, the water turns to steam, it can't slow the neutrons down anymore, and the reaction shuts down. So it's physically impossible to have a runaway chain reaction in a water moderated reactor. Chernobyl was not a water moderated reactor. It was a graphite moderated reactor. And graphite doesn't turn into vapor. it's solid. And so, it didn't have, this negative feedback. And in fact, the reactor operators did a crazy experiment in which they set off, a runway chain reaction. and then furthermore, another thing that Chernobyl reactor didn't have, which all, reactors in the civilized world have, is a containment building, okay? So all it had was an ordinary, building. And so when the reactor had a runaway chain reaction, it blew a hole in itself and a hole in the side of the building. And now you had the hot graphite exposed to air. And, so the graphite caught fire. And so this reactor was not only unstable, it was flammable, which is crazy. so you had the whole reactor literally go up in smoke and scattering, radioactive waste products, all over the landscape. the firefighters that were brought in to put the fire out were exposed directly to this cloud of radioactive material being, turned to radioactive smoke right at the reactor. And so about 80 of them were killed. then the fallout came down over a wide area. There's no documented, fatalities from that fallout. but a large area was evacuated and, has turned into an incredibly, flourishing wildlife reserve. but also, the response the Soviet authorities was completely incompetent. And, more could be said about that. But basically, the people who died at Chernobyl were not victims of nuclear power. They were victims of the Soviet Union.\nSpeaker C: Now, this is, totally anecdotal. I don't have any data to back this up, but when I speak to environmentalists today, I do see their perspective on nuclear softening a bit. Do you see that happening in the US. Or am I overstating that?\nSpeaker A: Well, you have a certain faction in the Democratic Party. It even has an organization called the Third Way. say, well, why aren't we going to nuclear? it's clean energy. It's the common sense answer. if you actually believe that global warming is an existential crisis that is, one that threatens the existence of the human race, it should take a lot of convincing to tell you that the hazard from nuclear power no nuclear power plant in the United States or, actually anywhere outside the Soviet Union has ever killed anyone. Not even at Fukushima, where, several nuclear power plants were destroyed by an earthquake and tidal wave. there was still no one, who got a harmful radiological dose outside of the plant gate. So here you have a situation where you've had over a thousand nuclear reactors on land or sea for the past.\nSpeaker C: 60 years not harming anyone now, beyond the benefits. So, no pollution, no greenhouse gases. you write in your book that also, could help opening the space frontier. So tell us what your argument was there.\nSpeaker A: Well, I mean, look, here's the thing. All the chemical elements that you need to make anything are on Mars, for example. But as is usually the case on Earth, with some exceptions, they're there in a useless form. In other words, you have iron, but it's in the form of iron oxide, silicon in the form of silicon dioxide and so forth. well, those can all be turned into useful resources if you have energy. Okay, now, what's the energy? Well, they don't have fossil fuels on Mars. You can make them, but it would take energy to do it. There's no waterfalls. the air is too thin for wind power to do much. You can do solar power on Mars, but it's only 40% as strong as it is on Earth. And on Earth, it's not terribly attractive. so it's significantly worse on Mars. So what are you going to do for power? Nuclear power. And if you look at the universe, the vast majority of it is far away from any star. so, the vast majority of the universe is dark. so whether you want to develop Mars or do interstellar travel or anything, you're, in general going to be operating out of range of effective solar power. It will take nuclear power to, develop space.\nRobert Zubrin says fusion is a doable thing\nSpeaker C: Does, Robert Zubrin watch movies? Did you happen to see Oppenheimer by any chance?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I did. And in fact, I wrote a review of Oppenheimer, favorable, for the, online magazine Quillette. they actually had two reviews, one by another person who focused on the artistic merit of the movie. I focused on, they asked me the question, is it, realistic? And, my answer was fundamentally yes. There's only one significant technical error in the film and that's its obsession over this question of whether people were worried that the first atom bomb would ignite the atmosphere. there was no such concern. I mean, Edward Teller did bring it up that we should do that calculation to make sure that that would not happen. But once the calculation was done, he was quite satisfied. and in fact, there was no chance whatsoever, that that could happen. fission of nitrogen would not release any energy at all. And fusion of nitrogen, occurs so slow that the various loss mechanisms would quench the reaction virtually immediately. what people were worried about at Trinity was whether it would work. Because you got to realize this is an incredibly complex thing and they're testing it for the first time. I ran an R and D company for 27 years and it's pretty rare that something new works the first time, but it did.\nSpeaker C: before I let you go, the future, is it going to be fusion?\nSpeaker A: Well, eventually, yes. I, think we will have improved, versions of fission. I think we'll have breeder reactors, I think loth thorium reactors. These things are on the way. but definitely fusion, is a doable thing. and right now, really, as a result of the success of SpaceX demonstrating, entrepreneurial approaches to reusable space launch vehicles, in other words, doing the impossible, so to speak investors have taken a look at advanced vision and fusion and said, maybe the reason why we don't have it is the wrong people are doing it. maybe the problem is institutional. And so you have both advanced fission and fusion entrepreneurial companies getting large amounts of funding from investors and these people are moving ahead on very fast timelines. So while, fission has stagnated, since its initial golden age of the think, we're going to have new kinds of fission reactors and we're going to have fusion as well.\nSpeaker C: Robert Zubrin. He's got a new book. It's called The Case for Nukes how We Can Beat Global Warming and Create a Free, open and magnificent Future. Robert, thank you so much for joining the program.\nSpeaker A: You are most welcome.",

        "text": "Wisconsin’s Democrat governor says Trump should be on ballot, Biden must visit to beat him\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin’s Democratic governor opposes keeping Republican Donald Trump off the ballot in the battleground state, saying that those who think he should be disqualified “can vote against him.”\nGov. Tony Evers also told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that in order for President Joe Biden to win Wisconsin, he must be a frequent visitor to the state and focus his message on his successes and issues that matter to the middle class, not just the argument that the fate of democracy is at stake.\nEvers’ comments come ahead of a visit to Wisconsin later this month by Vice President Kamala Harris and ahead of the planned filing Friday of a lawsuit by a Democratic activist aimed at keeping Trump off the ballot, arguing that his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot amounted to unconstitutional insurrection.\nOfficials in Colorado and Maine have already banned Trump’s name from primary election ballots. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court ruling from December that stripped his name from the state’s ballot.\nRemoving Trump wouldn’t “solve anything because, at the end of the day, I think the U.S. Supreme Court is going to say, ‘We’re going to let the people decide,’” Evers said.\n“Do I think that he has done things that make Donald Trump disqualified?” Evers said. “Yeah, but then people can vote against him.”\nAnd while the 81-year-old Biden’s age is “of course” a concern, Evers said he can win by showing younger voters why they should care.\n“I think democracy is on the line, but we also have to recognize what a great job he has done on infrastructure issues and other things,” Evers said, mentioning work to replace lead pipes. “He needs to be here, simple as that.”\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan agreed, saying Thursday he has told Biden he must come to Wisconsin to highlight his investments in roads, bridges and broadband expansion, and his efforts to bring down inflation and fight climate change.\n“He wants to do that,” Pocan said of Biden coming to the state. “He certainly understands the importance of Wisconsin.”\nFour of the past six presidential elections in Wisconsin have been decided by less than a percentage point, making the state one of a small number that could go either way in November. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes, less than 1 percentage point of all votes cast. That came after Trump narrowly won the state by a similar margin in 2016.\nBiden has been a frequent visitor to Wisconsin, making seven stops over the first three years of his presidency, most recently on Dec. 20 in Democratic-heavy Milwaukee. Harris is planning to kick off a series of nationwide events focused on abortion rights in Wisconsin on Jan. 22, the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats focused on fighting to restore abortion rights in winning campaigns across the country, including Evers’ reelection in Wisconsin. Polls in Wisconsin have shown broad, bipartisan support for legalized abortion.\nBut the most recent Marquette University Law School poll, released in November, shows that 79% of registered voters said “too old to be president” describes Biden very well or somewhat well, compared with 51% for Trump. Biden and Trump were running about even in the poll.\nEvers predicted a “high energy” campaign but was confident that voters will be able to cast their ballots without disruption or violence. He said normal preparations were underway at the state and local levels to ensure a smooth election.\nEvers said he anticipated that allowing local elections officials to process absentee ballots the day before an election would help the election run more smoothly. The Senate must pass the bill before it would go to Evers, who has pledged to sign it.\nCurrently, Wisconsin elections workers cannot process absentee ballots until polls open at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Trump and election skeptics have falsely claimed that late-night releases of ballots in large cities like Milwaukee are the result of election fraud.\nBeing able to process absentee ballots earlier is “going to make a big difference in making sure that this doesn’t run until 4 in the morning, which always gives people on the other side some creeps,” Evers said.\nThere has been widespread concern since 2020 about violence at the polls, overly aggressive partisan poll watchers and breakdowns in the ballot count. Trump has called for pardoning those prosecuted for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, continues to insist falsely that the 2020 election was “stolen” and says he will use the federal government to seek revenge on his political enemies.\nTrump fought to overturn his 2020 defeat in Wisconsin, losing numerous lawsuits that sought to toss out enough votes to give him the victory. Wisconsin was also one of seven battleground states where fake electors met and attempted to cast ballots indicating that Trump had won, a strategy at the center of criminal charges against Trump and his associates.\n“It’s unfortunate that a presidential candidate has to declare that he’s a winner unless it’s stolen from him,” Evers said. “That’s that’s a good reason to vote against somebody like that.”",

        "text": "A group of Creighton students protested outside of the Mike and Josie Harper Center during a Board of Trustees meeting to advocate for the university to commit to becoming carbon neutral by 2040.\nKatherine Mayer, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, led the protest.\n“I knew that at one of the quarterly board meetings, they were having student speakers talk about climate change and how worried the current student body is about it,” Mayer said. “I thought that was great, but I was just afraid that the board members would look at it like these are the only students who care, like this is just a minority. So, I wanted to organize something so that the Board of Trustees could see that people do want them to live up to the Creighton standards and the Creighton mission of caring for all people.”\nMayer said her goal was to spur a conversation about the university taking action to combat climate change.\n“I chose to kind of go the peaceful demonstration... route to hopefully spur conversation,” Mayer said.\nIn an email statement The Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, S.J., the university’s president, said Creighton is on track to be carbon neutral by 2050 and will achieve a 50% reduction in emissions below the 2010 baseline by 2028.\n“Most recently, we joined hundreds of other universities in signing the Climate Leadership Network’s Second Nature Carbon Commitment, affirming a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving carbon neutrality as soon as possible,” Hendrickson said in his email. “Creighton is also proud to be one of only five Jesuit universities in the United States that committed to divesting from fossil fuels.”\nDirector of The Office of Sustainability Programs Andrew Baruth, Ph.D., also emphasized Creighton’s commitment to sustainability.\n“Our current language is that we are working to figure out how much sooner before 2050 can we reliably get to net zero, with an aspirational goal to get to 2040 or sooner,” Baruth said. “I think for us it was about making sure we had the right data set and understanding how much further do we need to go to hit that milestone. We’re actually just finishing that reporting now which is quite exciting.”\nThe report Creighton is finishing is a Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System through The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, according to Baruth. It is the first time Creighton has completed this report since 2018.\nBaruth said reaching a carbon neutral goal is important, but it is not the only important goal.\n“We’re extremely mindful of where students are at, and what they’re needing and what they’re asking for. And it is encouraging us to think about how to respond and teeing up kind of how we will respond in these very practical ways of like, how are we going to go net zero,” Baruth said. “But I don’t want to de-emphasize the fact that there’s a lot more to sustainability that we don’t want to just kind of sweep under the rug, because I think as an academic institution if we miss those then we’ve probably missed the mark. A corporation can go net zero and that’s something, but as an academic institution we really need to work on these other pieces like literacy and cut some of those visual cues for sustainability.”",

Less is known The relationship between greenhouse gases and human breathing..\nScientists from Great Britain have Discover a new source of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, This is not what you expect.\nThose of University of Edinburgh The research conducted showed UK residents emit around 1,100 tonnes of methane and nitrous oxide every year Exhaled gases known as greenhouse gases.\nExplained in Study published in PLOS ONE, This discovery provides insight into smaller but neglected sources of greenhouse gas emissions..\nEmissions make up only a small portion of total production\nHowever, the study found Emissions represent a small proportion of the UK's total greenhouse gas production, By contributing only 0.05% and 0.1% of total human-caused methane and nitrogen oxide emissions, respectively.\nThe study was led by scientist Ben Dawson, under the supervision of Nicholas Cowan and Matthew Hill. who sought out lesser-known contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.\nAlthough significant sources of emissions, such as burning fossil fuels, are well documented Small sources, such as human breathing, are largely unknown, This leaves gaps in the comprehensive understanding of global emissions patterns.\nBeyond carbon dioxide\nIt should also be noted that the study did not focus on carbon dioxide. Because human exhalation of carbon dioxide is balanced by the carbon absorbed by the plants we eat during photosynthesis.\nHowever, it was lost Research has taken a major turn by examining nitrogen oxide and methane. These gases are produced by microbes in our digestive system. Which contributes to a significant increase in atmospheric values, Unlike carbon dioxide, carbon is neutral.\nTo collect data, The researchers analyzed samples of exhaled air from more than 100 volunteers They found that 31% of the participants exhaled methane, and all of them exhaled varying amounts of nitric oxide. Surprisingly, the study found There is no direct relationship between diet or demographics and levels of these exhaled gases.\nUsing population data, the researchers estimated total annual respiratory emissions of these gases in the UK. This is equivalent to about 1,040 tons of methane and 70 tons of nitrous oxide. Regarding the effect of greenhouse gases, This is equivalent to 53,900 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, It is a drop in the ocean compared to Britain's annual emissions of 417 million tons.\n“Alcohol buff.

        "text": "FORT WASHAKIE, Wyo. — A $619,500 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s America the Beautiful Challenge has been awarded to the Wind River Indian Reservation, the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapahoe Tribes and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition (GYC) to restore a tribal bison herd.\nAccording to the announcement by GYC, the grant will be used to grow the bison herd on the reservation from the current 150 animals on 3,000 acres to 1,000 animals on 100,000 acres. Funds will also be directed toward habitat restoration on the Big Wind River at Crowheart Warm Springs, home to trumpeter swans in the winter.\n“The mission of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition – working with all people to protect the lands, water and wildlife of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem – fits in with Indigenous values and beliefs,” GYC Senior Wind River Conservation Associate Wes Martel said in the announcement. “We believe water is life, buffalo is power and food is healing. Thanks to the grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, our team is ready to elevate Tribal conservation priorities within this important corner of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.”\nThe grant will also support community engagement and programs that promote food sovereignty and “opportunities for climate resilience.” Field trips designed to engage Tribal youth, Elders and community members in the sharing of Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge are also part of the plan.\n“The Indigenous Peoples of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are the steadfast stewards of this remarkable region,” GYC’s announcement said. “Since time immemorial, a deep and evolving repository of Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been used to live in dynamic reciprocity with nature.”\nThe America the Beautiful Challenge received more than 450 applications; 74 projects received funding totaling $141.3 million.\n“We need to begin addressing the impacts of drought and climate change that we have seen in recent years and work with the Elders and communities of both Tribes to make sure the coming generations have a reliable source of clean water,” Lokilo St. Clair, Acting Tribal Water Engineer for the Wind River Reservation, said in the announcement. “This planning grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation will enable the TWE Office and tribal communities to start developing an understanding of the challenges that lie ahead as we seek to protect lands, water and wildlife and our connection to Mother Earth.”",

        "text": "What’s News, Breaking: Friday, January 5, 2024\nATTORNEY GENERAL: NRA EXECUTIVE’S RESIGNATION\nGIVES NO INSULATION FROM ACCOUNTABILITY\nSTATEWIDE — NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION (NRA) EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT WAYNE LAPIERRE RESIGNED HIS POST ON FRIDAY, three days before a trial against him starts, and prompting a statement from New York Attorney General Letitia James. The attorney general in 2020 initiated a lawsuit — with the trial starting this Monday, Jan. 8 — alleging that LaPierre and NRA senior management misappropriated millions of dollars to fund personal benefits, including private jets, expensive meals, and even family trips to the Bahamas. The NRA, as a New York-registered not-for-profit, charitable corporation, has legal obligations to use its funds for charitable purposes specifically. “While the end of the Wayne LaPierre era is an important victory in our case, our push for accountability continues,” said Attorney General James. “LaPierre’s resignation validates our claims against him, but it will not insulate him or the NRA from accountability.”\nThe OAG investigation found that instead of serving NRA members, senior management blatantly disregarded New York state and federal laws, and even internal NRA policies.\n✰✰✰\nFAMILIES CAN SEE THEIR NEWBORNS FROM AFAR,\nTHANKS TO MAIMONIDES’ NEONATAL ICU EXPANSION\nBOROUGH PARK — MAIMONIDES MEDICAL CENTER HAS EXPANDED ITS NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (NICU), the hospital system announced on Friday, Jan. 5. The expansion of the NICU adds 17 NICU beds to Maimonides Children’s Hospital, bringing the total to 48 beds, each one outfitted with an Angel Eye camera that enables families to see their child from anywhere in the world via an app. The expansion includes other equipment-based resources to help support patients, families and medical staff in providing care.\nMaimonides is a New York State-designated Regional Perinatal Center, Level 4 NICU, which is equipped to offer advanced procedures, and provides around-the-clock coverage for all high-risk deliveries and care, including a neonatologist on-site 24/7.\n✰✰✰\nREPORT SHOWS BROOKLYN 2ND ON LIST OF RESIDENTS\nMOVING TO WAKE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nBOROUGHWIDE AND NORTH CAROLINA — BROOKLYNITES ARE MOVING IN DROVES TO WAKE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, the area near the state’s capital, according to a new report from WRAL, a broadcast station headquartered in Raleigh. The WRAL report showed Kings County in New York City comes in second regarding out-of-state new residents, after Cobb County, Georgia. The report showed also that Kings County and the other top ten counties around the U.S. that are losing residents to North Carolina are bringing in higher median household incomes than those already living in Wake County. However, a chart accompanying the report seemed to show the reverse: that the area median income in Wake County is higher, around $80K-$100K annually.\nThe report was generated from a question on the American Community Survey which asks where they lived the year before, giving a panorama of the annual movement around the country.\n✰✰✰\nGOVERNOR INTRODUCES NY SWIMS PROGRAM\nTO INCREASE POOLS, WATER SAFETY LESSONS\nSTATEWIDE — NEW YORK STATE WILL RECEIVE AN INVESTMENT IN SWIMMING POOLS, LIFEGUARD TRAINING AND SAFETY PROGRAMS, as part of a proposal that Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled in her State of the State address on Friday. The program, named NY SWIMS, will build out municipal pools in high-need areas, connect New Yorkers to the State’s rivers and lakes, deploy pools in urban environments and invest in State parks and pools. It will also promote initiatives to help more New Yorkers swim safely by addressing the statewide lifeguard shortage, increasing swimming instruction and increasing amenities at pools and beaches.\nNY SWIMS will select high-need areas to build pools, to mitigate the increase in heat waves attributed to climate change. It will also address the urgent need to teach water safety at an early age, as drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1-4.\n✰✰✰\nREP. MALLIOTAKIS HELPS SECURE\nFUNDS FOR WTC HEALTH PROGRAM\nCITYWIDE — CONGRESSWOMAN NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (NY-11) WAS SCHEDULED TO JOIN LOCAL POLICE, FIRE AND EMS UNIONS Friday afternoon to highlight the new funding she secured for the World Trade Center Health Program that covers health care costs for 9/11 first responders and survivors. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law at the end of 2023, included a bipartisan, bicameral amendment that Rep. Malliotakis supported. That amendment provides an additional $444 million to address the World Trade Center Health Program’s budget shortfall, plus $232 million to extend coverage for military and civilian 9/11 first responders at the Pentagon & Shanksville, PA.\nThe NYPD’s Benevolent Associations covering the city’s police officers, lieutenants, detectives, sergeants, captains, the FDNY’s firefighter and fire officers, and the Emergency Medical Services Association were among those participating.\n✰✰✰\nPROBE INTO IRT DERAILMENT SHOWS DISABLED TRAIN\nHAD COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER ONE IN MOTION\nCITYWIDE — SERVICE ON THE IRT IN MANHATTAN AND PARTS OF BROOKLYN WAS STILL PARTIALLY DISRUPTED ON FRIDAY, following a derailment at the Upper West Side’s 96th St. station Thursday, Jan. 4, around 3 p.m., that injured more than two dozen passengers. An investigation into the derailment continued beyond the Friday morning rush hour. The Daily News reported at 11:17 a.m. on Friday that a train found to be vandalized was pulled out of service, and while being moved to a Bronx maintenance yard, collided with a functioning northbound No. 1 train. The in-service passenger train had been green-lighted to proceed along the tracks, while the disabled train, which was being operated from the mid-train conductor’s cab (not normal procedure) had a red light and was not given permission to move. It then rammed into the in-service train mid-point, derailing it.\nNo. 2 trains were running along the East Side IRT 4 and 5 lines on Friday. Partial service restoration was expected by Friday afternoon.\n✰✰✰\nUFT, STATEN ISLAND BOROUGH PRESIDENT SUE MTA OVER CONGESTION PRICING PLAN\nDOWNTOWN BROOKLYN — THE UNITED FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND STATEN ISLAND BOROUGH PRESIDENT VITO FOSSELLA FILED A LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN ON THURSDAY, Jan. 4, to stop the MTA’S congestion pricing plan, reports the Daily News. The suit alleges that federal regulators prematurely approved the MTA’s plan to toll cars entering Midtown and lower Manhattan without weighing the “human environmental impact.” The plaintiffs claim that the congestion pricing plan, which will charge drivers $15 for entering the Manhattan central business district between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. — spanning the hours many teachers must commute to school — will punish teachers, firefighters and other city workers who commute to Manhattan for their jobs. Moreover, no exception has yet been made for the school buses that transport students.\nThursday’s lawsuit is the first brought in a New York-based federal court. New Jersey is bringing similar, twin legal challenges based on the environmental review.\n✰✰✰\nFORUM AIMS TO BUILD TECH CAREERS FOR BROOKLYNITES\nDOWNTOWN BROOKLYN — THE CREATION OF TECH CAREERS FOR BROOKLYNITES IS THE TOPIC OF POLICY FORUM taking place next Thursday, Jan. 11, with the Center for an Urban Future. The forum, titled “Helping More Brooklyn Residents Access Tech Careers,” and held from 8 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. at NYU Tandon’s Pfizer Auditorium, will focus on the opportunity for Brooklynites to expand access to tech careers here. Brooklyn-based leaders, including Borough President Antonio Reynoso and several elected officials, will discuss the borough’s tech education and training ecosystem, and examine the additional actions that policymakers, employers, educators and workforce practitioners can take to place more Brooklynites on the path to technology-powered careers.\nEducators and tech leaders participating in the forum will include Reuben Ogbonna, Executive Director of The Marcy Lab School; Kayon Pryce, Founding Principal, of the Brooklyn STEAM Center at the Navy Yard; Evin F. Robinson, Co-Founder & President of America On Tech; and Michael Zigman, President & CEO of NYC FIRST.\n✰✰✰\nAARP HONORS DR. TIM LAW, FOUNDER OF CHINESE SOCIAL SERVICES CENTER\nBENSONHURST — DR. TIM LAW, THE FOUNDER OF THE CHINESE AMERICAN SOCIAL SERVICES CENTER (124 AVENUE O) WAS RECENTLY AWARDED THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS (AARP’s) Andrus Award, which recognizes exceptional volunteer efforts on the part of individuals aged 50 and older. Assemblyman William Colton (D-47), who nominated Dr. Law for the award, presented it to the honoree. The award, he said, “Is given to community leaders who have played an important role in helping the community. That certainly describes Dr. Law, who has been a force for good in southwest Brooklyn since emigrating to the United States from China in 1968. Colton, whose district encompasses Bath Beach, Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights and Gravesend, said, “Over the years, Dr. Law has been involved in so many facets of the community, from education to organizing voter registration drives to food giveaways to speaking out on behalf of the immigrant community.”\nAARP stated, “Dr. Law has supported AARP’s vision and purpose because of his ability to ensure every person is treated equally with dignity and respect.”\n✰✰✰\nVIDEO: COPS RESCUE A MAN WHO FELL ONTO TRACKS AT CARROLL ST. SUBWAY STATION\nCARROLL GARDENS — TWO ALERT NYPD POLICE OFFICERS RESCUED A MAN who fell onto the subway tracks at the Carroll Street station in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn on Dec. 26. Officers Desmond Mohan and Kenly Garcia of the 76th Precinct were patrolling the station when they saw a 50-year-old man fall onto the tracks. They ran to haul him safely back onto the platform, and he was treated by EMS at the scene, according to the Daily Mail, where a bodycam video of the rescue can be seen.\nAmazingly, this rescue came just two months after Mohan and Garcia worked with the NYPD harbor unit to rescue a 20-year-old woman trapped under a Brooklyn pier.\n✰✰✰\nTRINITARIOS STREET GANG MEMBERS CHARGED IN FEDERAL COURT HERE\nDOWNTOWN BROOKLYN — A SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT WAS FILED TODAY IN FEDERAL COURT IN BROOKLYN CHARGING MEMBERS OF THE TRINITARIOS STREET GANG — two of them Brooklynites —with a string of violent crimes including multiple shootings and armed carjackings between November 2022 and February 2023. The defendants were previously arrested and will be arraigned on the superseding indictment at a later date. Defendants Amaury Guzmán, age 24, and Ian Diez (also known as “Gallina”), age 19, are both identified as being from Brooklyn, but no neighborhoods were specified. The crimes, which took place in Queens and New Jersey, included a murder, shootings and two armed carjackings.\nIf convicted, Guzmán and Jonathan Rodríguez of Queens are facing up to a life sentence; while Diez faces up to 15 years. The fourth defendant, Ruffi Fernández (also known as “Mojatoto”), of Staten Island faces 20 years in prison.\n✰✰✰\nVIRTUAL INFO SESSION ON PROPOSED ‘CITY OF YES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY’\nCITYWIDE — THE NYC DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING WILL BE HOSTING A VIRTUAL INFORMATION SESSION to answer “frequently asked questions” about Mayor Eric Adams’s “City of Yes for Economic Opportunity” proposal, on Tuesday, Jan. 9, at 11 a.m. via Zoom. City of Yes for Economic Opportunity, the second of Adams’ three City of Yes zoning initiatives, “would support small businesses and entrepreneurs, revitalize commercial corridors, boost growing industries, and bolster the city’s industrial sector,” DCP Director Dan Garodnick said in a release Wednesday. The FAQs will be voiced by DCP guests Kevin Guscott, Special Projects Manager for the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce; Rafael Espinal, Exec. Dir. of the Freelancers Union; and Laura Rothrock, president of Long Island City Partnership. RSVP here.\nFour community boards have voted in support of the controversial, business-friendly proposal, and four have voted to disapprove. The City Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on Jan. 24, followed by a vote in the spring.\n✰✰✰\nCOMPTROLLER LANDER: IMMIGRANTS A BIG PLUS TO NYC ECONOMY\nCITYWIDE — NYC COMPTROLLER BRAD LANDER DEBUNKED RISING ANTI-IMMIGRANT RHETORIC on Thursday by releasing a fact sheet detailing the many economic contributions immigrants and asylum-seekers make to the NYC economy. Not only are immigrant New Yorkers more likely to be employed, but they are also more likely to start a business, and contribute billions of dollars through taxes and spending, Lander said. In 2021, immigrant New Yorkers paid $61 billion dollars in taxes and constituted $138 billion dollars in spending power; undocumented immigrants contributed $18.6 billion in federal income taxes and $12.2 billion in state and local taxes. Immigrants also help the city compensate for residents moving out, Lander said.\nHistorically, New York City has experienced much higher immigration numbers than it is experiencing today, Lander said. In just one day in 1907, over 11,000 immigrants entered New York City through Ellis Island. Today the city welcomes up to 600 migrants a day seeking shelter.\n✰✰✰\nCITY COUNCILMEMBERS URGE ELECTIONS BOARD TO OMIT TRUMP’S NAME FROM BALLOT\nCITYWIDE — AS REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER DONALD TRUMP ASKED THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO OVERTURN COLORADO’S 14TH AMENDMENT RULING WITHOUT REVIEW, a majority of City Councilmembers here in New York have called on the State Board Of Elections to omit his name from the 2024 presidential primary and general election ballots, Gothamist reported on Wednesday, Jan. 3. The 29 Councilmembers, all Democrats, signed the letter. Together they assert that Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to Joe Biden but is currently the Republican frontrunner, is ineligible to hold office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution “because he engaged in and aided an insurrection against the United States after swearing to uphold the Constitution as the nation’s president.” The New York Times, moreover, published an analysis saying that 33 states have seen formal challenges to former President Trump.\nThe four state Board of Elections commissioners are evenly divided between the two major political parties.\n✰✰✰\nHOCHUL: EXPECT WINTRY MIX OF RAIN/SNOW IN NYC OVER WEEKEND\nCITYWIDE — GOV. KATHY HOCHUL TOLD NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS TO PREP for a wintry mix of either rain, wet snow or some of each this weekend. While the storm’s exact trajectory is not yet nailed down, the forecast predicts a large coastal weather system will hit much of the state beginning late Saturday and continuing into Sunday, with 3 to 8 inches of snow upstate and a mix of snow and rain in the New York City Metro Area.\nFor a listing of weather alerts and forecasts, visit the National Weather Service website.\n✰✰✰\nHOCHUL TEARS MUSCLE DOING HEAVY LIFTING — 80 POUNDS!\nUPSTATE — ‘PRETTY DAMN GOOD’: Gov. Kathy Hochul was wearing a white sling during an event upstate on Wednesday to discuss her Back to Basics plan to improve reading proficiency in New York, part of her 2024 State of the State. When asked about the sling, she revealed she had torn her pectoral muscle lifting 80-pound weights in the gym a day earlier, according to the New York Daily News via Yahoo. “You don’t think 80 pounds of weightlifting is pretty damn good for someone my age?” Hochul, 65, laughed. “I’ll be fine.”\nHochul said she will introduce legislation that ensures evidence-based best practices to teach reading are used throughout New York. She will also propose $10 million in state investments to train 20,000 teachers.\n✰✰✰\nMEDICAL BILLER CHARGED WITH 27 FELONY COUNTS IN THEFT OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION FUNDS\nBROOKLYN AND STATEWIDE — A MEDICAL BILLING FIRM OWNER WHO PROVIDED SERVICES TO A BROOKLYN ORTHOPEDIC PRACTICE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH STEALING MORE THAN $1 MILLION, Attorney General Letitia James announced on Wednesday afternoon, Jan. 3. Amrish Patel, 61, of Monroe Township, New Jersey, is accused of stealing more than $1 million that was supposed to be paid directly to doctors who provided medical care to injured workers under the New York State Workers’ Compensation Law. Patel, who provided billing services to a Brooklyn-based orthopedic surgery practice, allegedly submitted falsified claim forms to the New York State Insurance Fund, bilking at least $1.1 million in workers’ compensation reimbursements for himself.\nPatel and his two companies, Medlink Services, Inc. and Medlink Partners, LLC (together, Medlink), were charged with 27 felony counts for the thefts they allegedly committed over seven years from January 2012 through January 2019.\n✰✰✰\nCOURT ST. ‘R’ TRAIN STATION COMPLETELY ‘RE-NEW-VATED’\nBROOKLYN HEIGHTS — THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY HAS WRAPPED UP its top-to-bottom “Re-NEW-vation” of the Court Street R train subway station in Brooklyn Heights, the agency announced Wednesday. The Re-NEW-vation program gives dingy stations complete structural and aesthetic renovations. The work at Court Street included replacing wall tiles, updating lighting to LED, repaving concrete, replacing outdated signage and scrubbing clean subway globes. Workers also scrapped and repainted the entire station. Court Street marked the 53rd and final station to be re-NEW-vated in 2023, beating MTA’s goal of 50 a year.\nLocal officials including state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon and Councilmember Lincoln Restler said they were delighted with the cleanup. “I appreciate the MTA’s work in making that happen for all who use the Court St. Station, and I look forward to enjoying the fruits of their labor myself,” Gounardes said.\nLeave a Comment\nLeave a Comment",

        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis and state administrators have rejected at least $11 billion in federal funds in the past few years, saying there were strings attached, they “politicized” roads or fought climate change.\nThe programs affected include an expansion of Medicaid, rebates for energy-saving appliances and upgrades, a program to cut motor vehicle emissions, and summer lunches for children from low-income families. Millions of mostly low-income Floridians could have benefited from the funding, the governor’s critics say.\nAs the Legislature convenes on Tuesday to build next year’s state budget, federal COVID-19 recovery funds that have fueled tax cuts, road projects and padded the state’s $10 billion rainy day fund are drying up. State economists warn of a slowdown in tax revenue over the next few years.\nAt the same time, DeSantis continues campaigning for the Republican nomination for president by railing against the federal government’s spending. He also says he wants to plow several billion more dollars into the state’s ample reserves, despite no recession in sight.\nDemocrats say they believe the governor’s main goal is to target President Joe Biden.\n“It’s so painful to watch as DeSantis turns people into political talking points against the Biden administration,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said. “He’ll do it regardless of how it hurts his constituents in Florida. And since he has no logical reason for rejecting those funds, it must be political.”\nBut DeSantis does take federal funding for the programs he wants. About one of every three dollars in the $114 billion budget he recommended to the Legislature comes from federal coffers.\n“He’s happy to take federal funds for police officer bonuses or … to score political points,” Driskell said. “But there is no real nuance to why he rejects so many funds that would help Floridians and take credit for that, too. He just wants to draw a distinction between himself and Biden.”\nDeSantis Press Secretary Jeremy Redfern has said that the governor has the right to veto or turn down programs he considers to be bad policy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks — sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation and concert tickets among them — cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”",

        "text": "Guest opinion\nBig federal subsidies on solar mean Arizonans like us can harness sun's power\nBiden’s Inflation Reduction Act made it a no-brainer to finally install solar panels on our home\nWe took the leap to go solar and we’re glad we did.\nArizona’s 300 days of annual sunshine make the prospect of going solar seemingly obvious. But the shift can be daunting, especially when considering the costs involved. Thankfully, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, what was once a financial hurdle is now an opportunity.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act extends a generous 30% tax credit to homeowners like us who have wrestled with the idea of going solar. The actual tax credit amount varies depending on your tax bill, but the potential for savings is substantial.\nMy wife and I heard about a group called Solar United Neighbors (SUN), a collective force empowering homeowners interested in solar adoption. SUN operates as a co-op, leveraging the strength of numbers to negotiate with contractors and installation companies. This collaborative approach not only streamlines the process but also drives down costs for everyone involved.\nThe best part? SUN manages the negotiations, easing the transition to solar for homeowners like me and you, which was my favorite part of the transition to solar.\nShortly after signing up with SUN online we were contacted by a solar installation company that was vetted by SUN for us. The contractor came out to inspect our home and decided given our usage and the amount of light we get, the best plan for us would be 24 panels at 400 kw per panel.\nAfter that we were off to the races! We signed on the dotted line in mid-July, and it took less than a month for the city and our utility to approve our plan. Fifty days after first hearing from our installer solar panels adorned our garage, marking a significant step toward energy independence – cutting out long-term utility bills big time.\nThanks to the 30% tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act that my wife and I were able to take full advantage of, the transition will cost us $16,000 and we expect to fully recoup that investment in 8 years or less. Reducing our monthly costs is even more important as we both eye retirement in the coming years.\nThis fall we’ve made more energy than we use in the middle of the day, further reducing our monthly utility bill & helping us pay back the cost of installation quicker while reducing our carbon footprint – the very essence of our solar journey.\nThough we’re only a few months into the experience, the support provided by SUN has been invaluable. Looking ahead, we’re exploring taking advantage of additional tax credits to help pay for energy storage batteries to maximize the benefits of our excess midday power.\nWhether you’re looking to lower your energy costs, gaining independence from your utility, or contributing to the fight against climate change, exploring solar options with SUN is a move we recommend.\nEmbrace the sun, and let it power a brighter, more sustainable future for your home and our planet.\nThis report was first published by the Arizona Mirror.\nWill Humble is a long-time public health enthusiast and is currently the executive director for the Arizona Public Health Association. His 40 years in public health include more than 2 decades at the Arizona Department of Health Services, where he served in various roles including as the director from 2009 to 2015.",

        "text": "Saturday, Jan. 06, 2024|\nToday's Paper\n| 76.694°\nShare this story\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden more than a year ago, is a game-changing law that invests hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change and boost renewable energy.\nIt includes lucrative tax credits aimed at making it cheaper to produce clean hydrogen, which are expected to funnel more than $100 billion in taxpayer funds toward this nascent technology. As a fuel that releases only water vapor when burned, hydrogen is a promising tool to slash emissions from industries that will be harder to clean up through electrification, such as steel, cement, aviation and long-distance trucking.\nBut the climate benefits of hydrogen evaporate if they are made with fossil fuels. That’s why it’s important that federal officials ensure the most valuable incentives only support truly “green” hydrogen projects that do not add to carbon emissions. And it’s why it was something of a relief to see the Biden administration release unexpectedly stringent rules last month requiring that hydrogen projects meet rigorous life-cycle emissions standards to qualify for the most generous tax credits.\nIt’s much cheaper to produce hydrogen with methane, a highly polluting fossil fuel, than with electricity. These subsidies are designed to upend those economics by making hydrogen produced with renewable energy cost-competitive.\nClean hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules using massive amounts of electricity. These power-hungry projects can hog clean energy from other users and actually drive up consumption of fossil fuels.\nTo avoid this, environmentalists pushed to have hydrogen projects meet strict requirements to be eligible for the most generous tax credits of $3 per kilogram of “clean” hydrogen — including being powered by additional sources of zero-emissions electricity, such as wind and solar; being generated at the same time of day as the water-splitting equipment is operating; and being deliverable within the same region where the hydrogen is produced.\nThe Treasury Department standards released last month largely adhere to these principles, to the delight of environmentalists and the consternation of business groups, which pushed for laxer requirements, and fossil-fuel-friendly politicians like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III.\nCalifornia has much at stake because the Biden administration selected the state as one of seven regional “clean hydrogen hubs’’ across the country that will receive $7 billion in federal infrastructure funding. So it’s disappointing that the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, the state-led public-private consortium behind California’s hydrogen hub plan, was among the groups advocating against the tighter standards on the grounds that they would be too onerous and put clean hydrogen at a disadvantage compared with other technologies.\nBeing strict about what counts as green and clean is the right thing to do for the climate, as is reserving the greatest incentives to hydrogen production that actually reduces planet-warming emissions. Consumer advocates also have appropriately emphasized that such guidelines are needed to protect regular people from rising electricity rates that could result from hydrogen projects diverting power from existing renewable energy sources.\nState and federal leaders should monitor how these incentives are helping to grow a sustainable industry. We can’t afford to squander tens of billions of federal climate funding on projects with questionable environmental effects.\n— Los Angeles Times/TNS\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text": "Utah contest to replace Romney in U.S. Senate gains more GOP candidates\n(Colorado Newsline) John Curtis, a fourth-term U.S. House member from Provo, Utah, will join the Republican field to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, Curtis told States Newsroom ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday morning.\nCurtis is a late entrant in the Utah GOP primary race, which also includes former state House Speaker Brad Wilson and a hard-right favorite, Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs.\nIn addition to Wilson and Staggs, Brent Orrin Hatch, the son of the late U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, filed paperwork Tuesday to run for the seat. Sen. Hatch served for 42 years before his retirement in 2019.\nCurtis said in a Tuesday interview he hopes to leverage his experience in Washington, where he was ranked the ninth-most-effective House Republican by the nonpartisan research group Center for Effective Lawmaking.\n“I understand the ways the wheels move in Washington, how to pass legislation, how to get things done,” he said.\nA member of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus, which aims to advance “Republican solutions” to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change.\nCurtis said he grew up hiking and fishing in the Wasatch Mountain Range.\n“I was really disturbed by the Republican brand of not caring” about the environment, he said.\nThe Conservative Climate Caucus calls for a free-market approach to lower emissions, promotes research and development spending and highlights China’s role in growing emissions. Those policies are “in harmony with” Republican ideology, Curtis said.\n‘Not either one’\nUtah’s two sitting senators, Romney, who was often in the middle of bipartisan dealmaking during his term in office, and Mike Lee, who’s built a reputation as a conservative firebrand, present “a pretty good contrast,” Curtis said.\nBut he added neither one, representing opposite poles of the Senate Republican Caucus, would be models for him as a senator.\n“I’m not either one of them,” he said. “I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I just don’t think I’ve modeled myself after either.”\nAs senator, Curtis said he would prioritize climate and energy and public lands issues, which he said have been important to his Eastern Utah district.\nHe also said he’d like to focus on immigration policy.\n“I would love to be part of the solution there,” he said.\nUphill primary\nCurtis faces a crowded field in the Republican primary.\nWilson has raised more than $3 million and has the endorsement of the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox and scores of state lawmakers.\nStaggs has built a base of support in the wing of the GOP most loyal to former President Donald Trump. Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate from Arizona in 2022 and a Trump favorite, headlined a September fundraiser for Staggs.\nOther Trump-aligned figures, including former Defense Department official Kash Patel and far-right commentator Charlie Kirk, have endorsed Staggs.\nRomney, a former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate, won the 2018 race to replace Hatch. He was the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in each of the former president’s impeachment trials.\nStaggs and Wilson both began laying the groundwork for their campaigns before Romney announced in September that he would not seek reelection.\nThe primary election is scheduled for June 25. The Republican candidate will be heavily favored to win the general election in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly 2-to-1.\nColorado Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

        "text": "Harvard President Claudine Gay’s resignation puts an end to a short and embarrassing era at America’s oldest university. Her unfeeling response and admission, under oath to Congress, that calls for genocide against Jews and antisemitic speech do not violate university guidelines were public relations disasters. Her tolerance of Jew-hatred on campus enabled the worst instincts to surface and spread fear amongst Jewish students. The message sent to young Americans was clear: antisemitism is prevalent on our campuses, but there’s little we can and will do about it.\nHer resignation is necessary, but not sufficient to actually change the culture at elite universities. The increasingly radical and antisemitic views of a younger generation of college students are a feature, and not a bug, of today’s higher education.\nIt is therefore unsurprising that the views of college-age students, captured by a Harvard-Harris poll, on Hamas’s attack and Israel in general are so disturbing. Shockingly, 36% of 18-24 year-old respondents did not consider Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel a terrorist act, and 47% believed it targeted only the Israeli military, despite ample video evidence of war crimes against civilians. 32% even believed that Hamas’s murder, rape, and beheading of Israeli civilians was a “false story.” Even more disconcerting is the fact that 48% sided more with Hamas than with Israel, and 51% believed the attack could be justified by Palestinian grievances. Most troubling, however, is the revelation that 13% of young adults believe Hamas’s genocidal intent is justified.\nTo understand where these views come from, look no further than those given the responsibility to educate. According to a survey of international relations faculty conducted by William and Mary’s Teaching, Research & International Policy (TRIP) lab, faculty judged climate change (67%), U.S. domestic political instability (52%), and Russian revanchism (47%) as the largest threats facing the United States. Only 2% considered terrorism, exemplified by Hamas, a major foreign policy concern. International relations faculty in particular have critical views on American leadership in the world and advocate for limiting U.S. influence and leadership.\nHundreds of university faculty have blamed Israel for Hamas’s barbarism, tolerating if not indulging calls for a second Holocaust. More than 100 Harvard faculty signed a letter defending student mob chants of eliminating Israel as “free speech” and asserted that it was “Palestinian and allied students who are being targeted on our campus,” rather than Israeli and Jewish students. In a subsequent letter, many of these same faculty acknowledge that “there should surely be limits to what is speakable, even in a university,” putting to bed the canard that the university’s obligation and commitment to the First Amendment supersedes anything else.\nIf university leaders acknowledge and tacitly accept that antisemitism, calls for genocide, and support for these terrorist attacks form part of campus life, it is unsurprising that the students (whose worldview they mold) would hold such unsettling perspectives. The statement from the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, blaming Israel for Hamas’s attack – even before any Israeli response – is not an isolated viewpoint but mirrors the sentiments of nearly half of college-aged students. No amount of sensitivity or anti-discrimination training is going to change the reality that Jewish students are grappling with today on campuses.\nWithout intervention, one will continue to see so many companies, government agencies, and even elected leaders struggling with the internal radicalism of younger staff.\nInstead, alternate education and approaches must be developed. The recent announcement by Palantir that it would immediately hire 180 students who fear for their safety due to antisemitism is a welcome sign that America is still filled with patriots willing to stand up to narrow-mindedness. Organizations, like The Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS), which facilitates debate and challenges students to consider different perspectives on America’s role in the world, are vital in addressing the gaps in education. AHS assists student-led chapters on campuses across the country in bringing scholars and policy practitioners to campus to debate local faculty on the pressing foreign policy and national security issues of our day. With the world more dangerous today than it has been in a half-century, it is self-evident that our universities are not providing our young people with an education that allows them to understand what they are defending and why.\nGay’s abysmal response to the Hamas pogrom surfaced views that are deeply rooted in much of elite higher education. Harvard’s task must not only be to find a new leader, but to also find a new vision that will properly prepare our young people to lead and navigate a difficult and complex world.\nGabriel Scheinmann is the executive director of The Alexander Hamilton Society, and a graduate of Harvard College.",

        "text": "In 2022, Santa Barbara’s annual Christmas Bird Count took place in pouring rain, and with a few days to go, it looked like this year’s count was going to suffer the same fate. Fortunately, the rain arrived the night before, leaving just a few lingering showers on the morning of the count. The goals of the count are twofold: To see how many species can be seen in a day within the count circle, and to take a pulse on the numbers of birds wintering in Santa Barbara.\nWe used to always have one of the highest counts in the country for the number of species observed, but sadly, for a variety of reasons, we can no longer boast this distinction. Ten years ago, 222 species were tallied; this year, the preliminary total is 196 species. One of our big misses on December 30 were the seabirds. The count circle extends out into the channel, and intrepid birders go out by boat to look for jaegers, shearwaters, murres, and other ocean specialtists. This year, because of the huge swells that put a smile on the surfers’ faces, the boat had to be canceled, meaning we missed out on a big chunk of potential birds for the list.\n[Click to enlarge] The hooded merganser is one of the few wintering waterfowl that is actually increasing | Photo: Hugh Ranson\nThen there were the birds that were around just before count day but were nowhere to be found on December 30. I have seen a wintering warbling vireo each year for the past 11 years in Bohnett Park on the Westside. It’s a rare bird anywhere in the United States in winter, and I always managed to see it shortly after sunrise on the day of the count. I’d seen the bird in the weeks leading up to the count and figured it would be a slam dunk, but it wasn’t to be. During the day, I visited the park three times, spending several hours looking for my old friend. Had it moved out of the park and into the neighborhood? Or had it finally given up the ghost? After all, 11 is a grand old age for a small bird.\nIt will take some time to tally up the numbers of each species seen to be able to compare totals to previous years, but at the evening count compilation, one of the themes of conversation was the low numbers of birds. Waterfowl and shorebirds were in short supply. It appears that climate change is allowing many species of ducks and geese to winter further to the north than they used to. Usually, abundant birds such as lesser goldfinches and certain sparrow species were few and far between. The same phenomenon has been noted in birding listserv posts up and down the state. It remains to be seen whether this is a temporary decline, a shift in populations, or if something darker is afoot.\nOn a more cheerful note, what better way to introduce young people to the beauty of birds than the Santa Barbara Audubon Society’s Bird Count 4 Kids. Now in its tenth year, the event will be held on Saturday, January 20 at Lake Los Carneros Park from 9 a.m. till noon (register before 9:30 a.m.). The lake is one of the premier birding spots on the south coast with a great variety of birds usually present. The first 75 kids get a free t-shirt with a terrific new design — I liked it so much that I asked for one.\nThe morning is designed for those aged 8-16 (accompanied by an adult). There will be a binocular boot camp, and optics available to borrow. Experienced naturalists will lead small groups of children around the lake. I can’t think of a better way to help foster the next generation of nature lovers.\nAnother event to mark on your calendars is a presentation by author Jennifer Ackerman titled What an Owl Knows: The New Science of the World’s Most Enigmatic Bird. Ackerman will describe remarkable new findings about owls’ brains and behavior. This free multimedia presentation will be held at Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History’s Fleischmann Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 16.\nHugh Ranson is a member of Santa Barbara Audubon Society, a nonprofit organization that protects area birdlife and habitat and connects people with birds through education, conservation, and science.

        "text": 'Gang is featured in the new ABC7 special "Towering Figure: Jeanne Gang," now streaming.\nSAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Driving across the Bay Bridge, you\'ve likely noticed a spiraling, white high-rise with dynamic twists and turns. The MIRA Tower was created by the same creative genius that\'s behind The St. Regis Chicago, the world\'s tallest building designed by a woman.\nJeanne Gang is a global architect that\'s making her mark in the Bay Area, and she has some ideas on how to rebuild San Francisco.\nGang is featured in the new ABC7 special "Towering Figure: Jeanne Gang," now streaming.\nTowering Figure: How architect Jeanne Gang reshaped Chicago\'s spectacular skyline | WATCH\n"There\'s a lot of attention now being made to what kind of programs, what kind of activities can be brought into the buildings at the ground-level if they\'re losing retail or if they\'re losing, you know, population," says Gang.\nShe says it is a "blueprint" designed to bring San Francisco back to its "golden era."\nGang is one of the world\'s leading architects.\nShe\'s the creative genius behind The Mira: the eye-catching, twisting tower that dazzles in the skyline. Gang has dedicated her life to building. Her portfolio includes skyscrapers, boardwalks, and community centers. But in San Francisco, the emphasis is on rebuilding.\n"The city will turn around eventually, but there needs to be real attention to more housing. It\'s like many cities, it needs more housing," says Gang.\nMORE: New 840-foot building could be coming to downtown SF, city says more could follow it\nHousing is a critical issue in the City by the Bay. The recent exodus of retailers and workers has left downtown streets peppered with empty office buildings and boarded-up storefronts. But Gang remains optimistic.\n"It needs safe space. This is so important for cities. It\'s like in New York and the subway, for example, when no one\'s riding it, it feels less safe than when people really just embrace it," says Gang. "So we have to make sure that our infrastructure is working at capacity so that people feel comfortable using it and that\'s already like a step to making it safer."\nSan Francisco\'s neighbor Silicon Valley is a hub for innovation and creativity. Gang believes it will take creative solutions to help turn around the city\'s housing crisis.\nThat includes repurposing commercial properties for residential use.\nMORE: SF office to housing conversions would likely take 10 years to make a dent, expert says\n"When we design something from scratch, even thinking of the reversibility of it, how could it be made into more easily made into some other use in the future? So that makes the city more resilient as well. Just the ability to change and evolve," said Gang.\nIn the heart of Silicon Valley lies another big project for gang. She is designing the new Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.\n"They really want to have an impact and help find solutions for climate change," said Gang.\nGang says she is doing her part in finding solutions creating sustainable buildings and collaborative communities.\n"We see climate change is more and more visible and it\'s impacting everyone. There\'s social issues, there\'s polarization in our society. Acting or doing something every day that is addressing these issues helps me feel more positive toward what we can do as a society working together," said Gang.\nIf you\'re on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live',

(KGO) -- Powerful waves have compromised the Pacifica Pier, leading to a three-week closure.\nOn Thursday, the city's Public Works Engineering Division said on Dec. 28, a combination of high tides and large waves damaged sections of the pier's deck and concrete railing.\nNow, the pier will be closed for three weeks to undergo structural assessment.\nLynn Adams, president of the Pacific Beach Coalition, is not surprised.\n\"I'm really proud of them for making that call - I think it's the right thing to do we have to be safe,\" Adams said.\nVIDEO: Coastal Bay Area cities monitor high surf after damage from last week's powerful waves\nThe pier is a quarter of a mile long.\nAdams said it's a popular place, especially for those who fish for work or fun.\n\"Oh it's used - I mean sometimes it's elbow to elbow by people,\" Adams said.\nPacifica resident Tori Suarez lives down the block.\n\"Every day that people are allowed on it - there are people fishing a lot. These are people who do it for a living you know, do it to feed their families and stuff and so it's a really critical part of Pacifica,\" Suarez said.\nSuarez said public works crews have been busy in the area. A recent sinkhole off Beach Boulevard grew from 2-4 feet to practically half a block wide.\nMORE: Incredible videos show dangerous surf pounding NorCal coast\n\"The waves are so strong when they come crashing across the street - they've actually broken garage doors. So garage doors have buckled so people are having to board up their garages,\" Suarez said.\nThe city tells ABC7 News they understand this is a heavily used place - it's one of the only piers where people can fish for free. Sometimes they can see up to 2,000 visitors a day.\nLisa Petersen, the Public Works director for Pacifica, says a structural assessment last spring looked at damage from previous storms.\nNow, the city will combine those findings with this new assessment for a finalized report.\nThe Pacifica Pier was built in 1973.\nMORE: Rogue wave hits California, flooding streets and sweeping people off their feet in Ventura\nPetersen estimates repairs could cost around $20 million.\nPetersen said the city is actively looking for grant funding. The pier is an expensive endeavor.\nThe assessment is expected to be completed by Jan. 25; afterward the city will determine if the pier can be reopened.\nLynn Adams, a longtime Pacifica resident herself said the pier is a wonderful resource valued by people from all over the state.\nAdams said the severity of the storm damage speaks to the sea level rise and climate change.\n\"The question is, how can you stop that much force? We have to look at nature. You know Mother Nature wins and predicates what we need to do next,\" Adams said.\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live",

        "text": 'Azerbaijan names a former oil executive to lead 2024 climate talks\nAzerbaijan\'s ecology minister has been named to lead the United Nations\' annual climate talks later this year, prompting concern from some climate activists over his former ties to the state oil company in a major oil-producing nation.\nMukhtar Babayev\'s appointment was announced on X by the United Arab Emirates, which hosted the climate talks that just ended in December, and confirmed Friday by the United Nations. Officials in Azerbaijan did not immediately respond to messages seeking to confirm the appointment.\nBabayev, 56, has been his country\'s minister for ecology and natural resources since 2018. Before that, he worked at Azerbaijan\'s state oil company for more than two decades.\nSimilar concerns dogged Sultan al-Jaber, the head of the UAE\'s national oil company, as he presided over the talks in Dubai known as COP28. The COP president is responsible for running talks and getting nearly 200 countries to agree on a deal to help limit global warming, and skeptics questioned whether al-Jaber would be willing to confront the fossil fuels causing climate change.\nThe conference ultimately resulted in a final agreement that for the first time mentioned fossil fuels as the cause of climate change and acknowledged the need to transition away from them, but it had no concrete requirements to do so.\nOil and natural gas bring in around 90% of Azerbaijan\'s export revenues and finance around 60% of the government budget, according to the International Energy Agency. Climate activists said the country needs to look past its own fossil fuel interests if it\'s going to host successful talks.\nClimate activists worry about an oil-producing state hosting talks\nMohamad Adow of climate think tank Power Shift Africa said it\'s "concerning to be once again having the world\'s climate negotiations coordinated by a petrostate that has a big interest in oil and gas production." But he was hopeful that climate negotiators could be successful in Azerbaijan\'s capital Baku as "the COP in Dubai resulted in an outcome more positive than many expected."\n"He\'s got a huge job to do," said Adow. "He needs to start working on getting rich countries to deliver serious, long-term finance that will tackle the climate crisis."\nHarjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said that "with another petrostate hosting the climate conference, our concerns multiply."\nBabayev "must transcend the vested interests of the powerful fossil fuel industry that is primarily responsible for the climate crisis," Singh said.\nMelanie Robinson, global director for the climate program at World Resources Institute, didn\'t comment directly on Babayev but said "stakes will be high" in Azerbaijan, where nations will tackle issues including how to finance climate change adaptation and mitigation around the world, particularly in poorer countries.\n"As with all presidencies, the world will be looking to Azerbaijan to fairly facilitate the most ambitious outcome possible," she said.\nThe United Nations moves the talks around the world with different regions taking turns. They\'re typically announced two years in advance, but the decision to hold 2024 talks in Azerbaijan came just 11 months before the negotiations are supposed to start.\nThat was due to a longtime standoff between Eastern European nations, the region designated to host in 2024. A prisoner swap between Azerbaijan and Armenia in early December led to Armenia supporting Azerbaijan\'s COP29 bid.\nCopyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.',

        "text": "Golf is so much more fun when the players are petty. From Ryder Cup shenanigans to guys getting pissed about the pace of play, the game is infinitely more entertaining when there’s a clearly defined heel who fans can collectively hate. That’s why the past year-plus of golf was great television.\nHowever, the impending (stalled-out?) merger of the Saudi Public Investment Fund and the PGA Tour is homogenizing the callousness of “businessmen” across the leaderboard. The latest fervently anti-LIV golfer to roll over was arguably the most outsized voice against defectors: Rory McIlroy.\n“I was maybe a little judgmental of the guys who went to LIV Golf at the start,” McIlroy said on Gary Neville’s podcast, The Overlap. “I think it was a bit of a mistake on my part because I now realize that not everyone is in my position or in Tiger Woods’ position.”\nFor those of us hoping McIlroy would hold strong/stay petty, it’s a disappointment, but far from a surprise. Once you see a supposed ally in Jon Rahm become a $600-million bargaining chip it’s hard to blame them — I guess.\n“I thought it was a smart business move from Jon – it’s opportunistic. I think he sees that things will come back together and he’s in a lucky position, McIlroy said. “There’s not one person that wouldn’t want him on our Ryder Cup team because of how good he is, so he was in a great position where there wasn’t a ton of risk involved for him to go. I’ve got no problem with him going if that’s what he wants to do and he thinks that’s the right decision for him and his family. Who am I to say any different at this point?”\nAh, yes, empathy for the pro athlete who can now feed his family for eight, or nine generations, all from an ability to hit a ball. Call me a cynic (guilty), but could McIlroy simply be saving face because he’s about to share a locker room with a litany of goons that he’s been (rightfully) skewering over the past 16 months?\n“I wouldn’t say I’ve lost the fight against LIV,” said McIlroy. “But I’ve just accepted the fact that this is part of our sport now.”\nIt’s not a coincidence that acceptance is the final grieving stage. Boy, I can’t wait for an onslaught of golf fans to paraphrase that talking point from now until climate change kills off all the grass on Earth.\nOf McIlroy’s myriad profound (profane?) utterances during his mea culpa, this next one was my favorite.\n“I’ve gone through the last two years with this altruistic approach where I’ve looked at the world the way I’ve wanted to see it. Ultimately, you can say what you want and do what you want, but at the end of the day, you’re not going to be able to change people’s minds. You’re never going to make them decide based on what you say.”\nGod dammit, if that’s not what I try to do literally every day at this job. What I do is on a far lesser scale, with a lot less exposure, for pennies compared to Rory, yet to say that you’re not going to do what’s right because it doesn’t make a difference is completely defeatist and some crap a despot would proclaim.\nGive in, give up, what’s the point? And, hey, blood money “exposed the flaws in the system of golf” so it can’t be all bad, right? You know you’ve done something indefensible when Phil Mickelson defends you.\n“This quote and the many others made today by Rory probably weren’t easy to say,” Mickelson tweeted Wednesday. “Let’s not use this as an opportunity to pile on. Rather, it’s time for me and others to let go of our hostilities and work toward a positive future.”\nYou know what? Lefty is . . . still a complete moron. Yes, bask in the ever-growing bank accounts and sing Kumbaya while innocent journalists get cut to pieces and the women of Saudi Arabia live a life that’s centuries behind the rest of the world’s female population.\nScrew you, Rory.",

        "text": "HOUSTON (KIAH) — Houston’s District K Council Member Martha Castex-Tatum has partnered with South Post Oak Recycling Center to encourage residents to recycle their old or broken Christmas lights, extension cords and metal tree stands instead of throwing them away. Residents can get cash when turning them in!\nFor the second year in a row, Houstonians can bring their metal items to South Post Oak Recycling Center and receive cash in exchange. This will help keep them out of landfills and conserve natural resources. The program not only incentivizes recycling but also educates the public about the importance of proper waste management and environmental conservation. The ‘cash-for-lights’ incentive offers a tangible benefit to participants, making environmental consciousness financially rewarding.\nBENEFITS OF RECYCLING:\nConservation of Natural Resources: Recycling enables the recovery and reuse of valuable materials. For instance, copper in the wires of Christmas lights and extension cords, and metal in tree stands can be recycled and used in the production of new products, reducing the need to extract more raw materials from the earth.\nEnergy Savings: The process of recycling materials generally consumes less energy compared to producing items from raw materials. For example, recycling copper from old lights and cords uses significantly less energy than mining and refining new copper.\nReduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions: By recycling, we reduce the energy needed for manufacturing and extracting raw materials, which in turn lowers greenhouse gas emissions. This contributes to the fight against climate change.\nEconomic Benefits: Recycling creates jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries. It also promotes a sustainable economy by reducing the need for new materials and the costs associated with waste disposal. Recycled materials have value, and people can make money by turning them in.\nReduce Landfill Waste: By recycling these items, we conserve space in landfills, which are rapidly filling up. This helps manage waste more efficiently and reduces the volume of material going into landfills unnecessarily.\nEncouraging Sustainable Practices: Recycling these items sets a positive example and encourages more sustainable living practices. It raises awareness about the importance of recycling and can lead to more environmentally responsible behavior.\nSupport for Local Communities: Some recycling programs for Christmas lights and related items are run by local communities or charities. Participating in these programs can support local initiatives and community development.\nDIGITAL DIVE:\nAfter the live interview, the Mayor-Pro Tem and Brandi Harleaux stopped by CW39’s digital studio to talk more in depth about their partnership, individual initiatives and accolades, plus how they navigate working in male dominated industries.\nYou can hear more of that conversation below:\nMayor Whitmire appoints Martha Castex-Tatum as Mayor Pro-Tem\nThank you @Houmayor John Whitmire. I look forward to the great work we will do together on behalf of Houstonians.

        "text": "Natural Asset Companies latest in land schemes\nA proposed rule by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission would allow a new type of company with the rights to manage public and private lands to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of these companies could then potentially be purchased and controlled by anti-agriculture interests or foreign adversaries.\n“To address the large and complex challenges of climate change and the transition to a more sustainable economy, NYSE and Intrinsic Exchange Group (IEG) are pioneering a new class of listed company based on nature and the benefits that nature provides (termed ecosystem services).” the New York Stock Exchange said on its website, announcing Natural Asset Companies (NAC).\n“NACs will capture the intrinsic and productive value of nature and provide a store of value based on the vital assets that underpin our entire economy and make life on earth possible,” NYSE wrote.\nAs publicly tradable securities, NACs hold rights and management of forests, wetlands, and coral reefs, as well as farm and rangelands. Instead of being focused on traditional accounting practices and returning profits to the shareholder, NACs would instead be rated based on “natural processes,” and prioritizing conservation and “sustainable practices.”\nUnder the proposed SEC rule, “sustainable practices” are defined using the United Nations System of Environmental and Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting Framework (SEEA EA). However the UN standards may not be in line with the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or U.S. law.\nSimilar to the Biden Administration’s “30×30” agenda — which would place 30 percent of U.S. land and coastal waters into permanent conservation by 2030 — NACs pose a major threat to rural economies by removing working lands from production or by severely limiting what kinds of uses those lands are available for. The runoff impact to land valuations could also handicap local governments that rely on tax revenues to fund essential services like hospitals, roads, schools, and emergency services.\nThe SEC quietly introduced the rule in September 2023, with an unusually short 21-day public comment period. However, on Dec. 28, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission published a notice in the Federal Register reopening comments on the NAC proposed rule. The new comment deadline is January 18. Comments can be submitted at to the SEC website at https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/sr-nyse-2023-09.\nThis is the second time the SEC has delayed approving NACs, and in addition to extending the comment period, the SEC has also instituted proceedings requiring The New York Stock Exchange and Intrinsic Exchange Group to show that NACs do not violate securities law.\nCONGRESS PUSHES BACK\nNebraska Senator Pete Ricketts and Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch sent a letter to the SEC on Nov. 2, 2023, expressing their concerns.\n“The proposed rule would allow for federal lands, including national parks and other publicly owned lands, to be included in private investment portfolios,” the senators wrote. “[It] also allows for NACs to have management authority over assets held in the portfolio, including our public lands.”\nThe senators argued that the SEC is creating incentives for non-government corporate control over public lands, which could create unintended consequences.\n“The proposed rule could lead to a preservationist-only approach to federal land management instead of an ‘all-of-the-above’ working lands approach as intended by the creation of our federal land programs,” they wrote. “We are also alarmed by the SEC’s allowance under the proposed rule of foreign investment in these uniquely U.S. assets. At a time in which we are actively working to deter our adversaries, we should not be open our federal lands up to investment from the same adversaries.”\nThirty-one House Representatives, many of them from majority public lands states, also sent a letter to the SEC on Dec. 15, 2023, encouraging the SEC to reopen the comment period and requesting information, including how the SEC has the right to confer “management authority” over federal lands.\n“This proposal is complex and based on a novel, non-traditional investing mechanism that would seemingly allow for the buying and selling of certain undefined ‘rights’ to certain private and public lands, including foreign nations and noncitizens, to terminate and prevent all economic activities on such properties,” the representatives wrote.\nThe creation of Natural Asset Companies dovetails with a recent Bureau of Land Management rule proposal that prioritizes conservation over the multiple-uses (mining, grazing, and recreation) that Congress authorized under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act.\nIn alignment with the ’30×30′ agenda, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have sought to leverage conservation easements on private lands surrounding its existing National Wildlife Refuges to extend the amount of lands placed in permanent conservation. Those easements could then be purchased and included in an NAC portfolio.\nSuch an arrangements would provide multiple avenues for adversarial outside interests to end grazing on federal lands and conservation easements, as well as prohibiting oil and gas exploration during a time of increased tension and uncertainty in the Middle East.\nCONSERVATION EASEMENT ISSUES\nMargaret Byfield with property rights non-profit American Stewards of Liberty said that beyond public lands, owners of existing permanent conservation easements are under threat from Natural Asset Companies.\nMost landowners don’t think to include language in an easement contract that says that their easement cannot be transferred to a different owner, Byfield said, much less a provision that says their land cannot be enrolled in a financial product.\n“You cannot write an easement contract that benefits the landowner in the long run,” she said.\nByfield said that Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, who has long been an outspoken opponent of permanent conservation easements, has introduced language to the next Farm Bill that would provide sunsets for easements, allowing landowners the opportunity to buy back their easement and to negotiate better tax incentives for multi-generational landowners beyond the traditional one-time tax benefit. Hageman also led the 31 House Representatives who signed the letter to the SEC encouraging it to reopen comments on the NAC rule.\nByfield said that other proposals include counties and states placing a 10 percent cap on total conservation easements or other conservation vehicles in a given county in order to protect the revenues that counties rely on to support local essential services.\n“Conservation easements make the counties more beholden to Federal and State Dollars,” Byfield said.\nMore information about Natural Asset Companies is available at https://americanstewards.us/natural-asset-companies/",

        "text": "Budd-Falen: Is the Stock Market Trading on America’s Demise?\nI admit I do not know a lot about the stock market (lawyers don’t do math, or at least this one doesn’t) but I do understand that the point of the stock market is to bring investors and companies together, allowing the investors to provide financial backing for companies that investors believe are on solid financial footing. Investors then hope to receive a dividend or return on their investment. The first U.S. stock market was created in 1792. In 1817, that market was renamed the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). After the crash of the stock market in 1929, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure transparency, fair prices for trading and a high degree of liquidity for traders. The SEC is a federal agency that works independently and without political pressure.\nUnfortunately, that mission is about to change. On Sept. 29, 2023, the SEC announced a proposed rule that looks to be politically motivated, does not protect investors because they never get a monetary return on their investments and harms the American economy rather than supporting it.\nThe proposed rule allows for the formation of private companies (called Natural Asset Companies (NACs)) to acquire private lands and eliminate most all economic use of those lands. While I believe in the Constitutional protection for the use of private property, I am sure the founding fathers did not envision a federal agency to allow foreign governments (including those whose interests are completely averse to America) to acquire and eliminate use of private and public lands, while being funded through the NYSE.\nThis crazy trading scheme is based on several faulty premises. First, the ownership and use of private property is governed by state law, not federal law. As stated above, the SEC proposed rule specifically allows foreign ownership in NACs. According to research by the National Ag Law Center, in 2023 alone, 12 states passed laws restricting foreign ownership or investment in private lands located within their\nstates. This is added to the 12 states that already have state laws limiting foreign ownership of private land within those states. Henry Kissinger famously said, “Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.” Do we really want countries that hate America owning and controlling American agricultural land, energy production, timber assets and American minerals?\nSecond, the SEC equates “no use” to the conservation and sustainability of natural resources. This is a completely false premise. Often human management is what sensitive environments need to keep them healthy. Not allowing human management to be part of “conservation” will be both detrimental to the environment, and to the natural resource industries that are essential to local economies. The SEC proposed rule notes that destruction of federal lands can be caused by wildfire and climate change. However, the elimination of well managed livestock grazing and timber production by NACs will increase these destructive harms, not eliminate them. Both livestock grazing and the harvesting of timber reduce the risk of wildfires by reducing the fuel load needed for those fires. According to a June 22, 2022 article in Rangelands Magazine, “Moderate grazing decreases wildfire probability by decreasing fuel amount, continuity, and height and increasing fuel moisture content. Grazing, through its modification of fuels, can improve fire suppression efforts by decreasing flame lengths, rate of fire spread, and fire severity.”\nAlso concerning is the SEC’s statement that NACs are required to manage their acquisitions for “ecological and socially equitable goals.” Is displacing a 5th generation rancher in rural America truly an ecological or socially equitable goal? It is certainly not for the rural communities, rural counties and the citizens who live in these areas.\nIt is frightening that a federal agency who is supposed to be independent would feel the political pressure to implement a rule on climate change. Comments are due to the SEC by January 18, 2024. This proposed rule is not what the founding fathers would have envisioned.",

        "text": 'The mayor of Superior is asking Wisconsin utility regulators to revisit their approval of a roughly $700 million natural gas plant that’s planned to be built in the city.\nIn a letter filed on Jan. 2, Superior Mayor Jim Paine asked the Public Service Commission, or PSC, to conduct a new review of the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center.\nSeveral utilities want to build the 625-megawatt plant as part of plans to shift away from coal and invest in renewable energy. They include La Crosse-based Dairyland Power Cooperative, Minnesota Power in Duluth and North Dakota-based Basin Electric Power Cooperative.\nThe project’s owners say the plant is critical for providing reliable, affordable power when energy from wind and solar resources are unavailable. Indigenous and environmental groups have long-opposed the project and mounted multiple legal challenges over its approval by regulators in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\nIn 2020, the PSC issued a certificate to utilities, granting them approval to build the power plant. At the time, Paine said local leaders supported the project due to the economic benefits of construction and shifting to clean energy. Now, he said, many local officials oppose it.\n"The project, the site, the community, and the world have changed in meaningful ways since January of 2020. The final decision of the PSC is no longer a true representation of the facts surrounding the construction of (the Nemadji Trail Energy Center)," Paine wrote. "The citizens of Superior and Wisconsin deserve further review of this controversial and potentially harmful project."\nThe city’s leader said changes to the project warrant further review, including modifications to its design, ownership and effects on tribal lands.\nPaine noted the site is about 500 feet from a mass grave that holds the remains of tribal ancestors of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. The remains were buried there more than 100 years ago following their removal from Wisconsin Point to make way for an ore dock that was never built.\nSign up for daily news!\nStay informed with WPR\'s email newsletter.\nSuperior’s mayor also added that advancements in technology and federal funding for clean energy development under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have made it possible to pursue renewable resources, rendering new fossil fuel plants "obsolete." Paine also questioned whether the city would be able to enforce its own ordinances related to the plant, noting state law preempts enforcement of local regulations for approved projects. The city would have to amend its zoning code and vacate streets for the plant, and Paine said the city is unlikely to approve those changes.\nA PSC spokesperson said the commission is reviewing the mayor\'s request. The commission hasn\'t acted on a similar request made by environmental groups last year.\nUtilities want to break ground on the plant next year. They estimate it would create more than 350 jobs during construction, as well as 25 full-time positions. The project’s owners and labor groups say the project will bring a $1 billion economic impact over 20 years.\nDairyland Power is seeking a loan from the Rural Utilities Service to pay for half the plant’s cost. Last month, the federal agency found the plant won’t have significant effects on the environment as part of its latest review of the project. The agency had previously issued a similar finding, but it revisited the decision after environmental and Indigenous groups petitioned for further review.\nUtilities have said the plant would cut carbon emissions by 964,000 tons each year. In its latest finding, the Rural Utilities Service found the plant would cut carbon emissions on the western portion of the Midwest grid by more than 800,000 tons each year compared to keeping coal plants online.\nThe agency’s interim estimates also showed the facility would produce around $2.5 billion in climate damages. Even so, regulators said the plant would reduce climate impacts by about $1.2 billion as it replaces older coal facilities.\nEnvironmental and Indigenous groups have challenged the agency’s assessment of the plant\'s effects on climate change and tribal communities.\nThe Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin are appealing a Dane County judge’s ruling last year that upheld the project’s approval by the Public Service Commission. That litigation is still pending.\nUtilities hope to bring the plant online in 2028.',

        "text": "By the end of 2023, European shoppers could breathe a small sigh of relief after inflation slowed faster than many economists had expected. This was a welcome respite from the stomach-churning 10.6% rate recorded at the height of the region’s energy crisis in October 2022.\nNevertheless, cost of living pressures are still being felt by many families across Europe. Interest rate rises have caused European economies to slow down, with eurozone countries seeing output decrease by 0.1% in the period of July to September.\nGermany, the continent’s economic powerhouse, is now at risk of falling into a technical recession after its economy shrank in Q3. Meanwhile, inflation in the U.K., despite reaching its lowest rate in two years, remained stubbornly high at 3.9% for November, compared to 2.4% in the eurozone.\nIt is encouraging to see, therefore, that while budgets were still tight for many European families this year, shoppers’ commitment to sustainability remains firm. According to research commissioned by Elopak and carried out by Absolute Market Research, 75% of U.K. consumers consider companies’ environmental commitments to be important when making shopping decisions, with one-third willing to switch to brands that are taking steps to be more sustainable.\nConcerns over sustainability are particularly pronounced in the food and drink market, with four out of five consumers saying they intentionally choose products with a sustainability claim. Within this, packaging is regarded as an important touchpoint, as a third of shoppers claim to make environmentally conscious decisions about their packaging choices and three-quarters of those surveyed said they prioritise fully recyclable packaging.\nLikewise, the Sustainable Consumer survey by Deloitte found that single-use plastic packaging is a serious concern for U.K. shoppers, 64% of whom said they try to limit the amount they use in 2023. This figure has remained consistent since 2022, despite the ongoing cost of living squeeze.\nEven in a market with as persistent inflation as the U.K., we are seeing many of the green habits formed during the pandemic continue to flourish. Packaging is evidently an important medium for empowering this behavior, with 55% of respondents saying they prefer to get information about a product’s environmental impact directly from its packaging.\nHowever, the research by Deloitte shows that affordability continues to be a barrier to even more sustainable shopping habits. Of the U.K. consumers surveyed, 62% said high prices are holding them back from being more sustainable, while 52% said they want sustainable alternatives to be more affordable.\nInformation is also an important factor in empowering more sustainable choices. Modern shoppers have never been so engaged with the products and packaging they purchase, with 72% of those surveyed by Elopak interested in learning about a product’s environmental impact. A similar proportion (seven in ten) said they are keen to learn about the environmental impact of the packaging they buy.\nHowever, awareness of products’ environmental benefits is currently inconsistent. While 67% of survey respondents said they feel well-informed about the concept of recycling, only 33% say they adequately understand a product’s carbon footprint and just 13% feel au fait with the circular economy. This presents an opportunity for businesses that are walking the walk on sustainability to spend more time and resources on explaining these benefits to consumers.\nAs we look to 2024 and the prospect of further economic recovery beyond, we can be all but certain that consumer demand for sustainability will continue to grow. Elopak’s research found that two-thirds of consumers said they were likely to move to a brand which demonstrated they were taking steps to mitigate climate change, assuming price and availability were the same. This was even more pronounced among younger generations, with Gen Z scoring the highest of all.\nBusinesses will therefore need to invest in innovations that offer more sustainable options to consumers while doing everything possible to keep prices stable. They will also benefit from educating consumers about their sustainability goals in greater detail.\nIn both instances, packaging is a useful tool that provides a well-understood platform for sustainable innovation, as well as a useful medium for giving consumers access to information. Getting this right could bring substantial upsides for companies: slashing emissions and building a loyal customer base among the next generation of shoppers.\nThomas Körmendi is the CEO of Elopak, a global supplier of carton-based packaging.\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n- Economic pessimists’ bet on a 2023 recession failed.

Expect the gender-identity delusion to be downplayed and the typical “Republicans pounce” narrative to emerge.\n6. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Saks) has had enough of the United Nations pretending they care about the Alabama inmate set to be killed by nitrogen hypoxia. Rogers tweeted, “China unjustly executes thousands per year, including nonviolent offenders, all while committing genocide. So naturally, the UN Human Rights Council is focusing their efforts on stopping a humane method of execution on a convicted murderer in Alabama.”\n5. Charges for a police officer in Decatur are expected to be filed today, the charge will reportedly be murder for the Sept. 29 killing of Steve Perkins outside his home. The case has led to months of protests, memorial silliness, and threats. Police were alerted to Perkins threatening a tow truck driver with a gun and returned to the scene with the tow truck driver when Perkins allegedly exited his home with the firearm again and was shot by police.\n4. Alabama Democrats are publicly pushing back against school choice in Alabama and are now calling Education Savings Accounts “vouchers.” They are beholden to teachers’ unions that view options and competition as the worst thing that could ever happen because they know many parents will choose something else.\n3. President Joe Biden’s entire re-election campaign appears to be set to hinge on two things, dementia and demonization. The White House is telegraphing that a lot of demonization is on the menu for a speech Biden will read in Pennsylvania today with a heavy dose of Jan. 6 talk and talk of fears for our “democracy,” as his allies try to disqualify his main opponent.\n2. Alabama’s delegation is hitting Biden hard on the issues, with U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) declaring it is time to “reinstate President Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy immediately” and that Trump-era policies are needed as the record-breaking numbers are only going up with 2020 seeing 405,036 apprehensions and 2023 seeing 3,201,144 but the number of those released and not ever contacted goes up as well. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Auburn) slams Democrats on their failure to secure the border and highlights that the open border they have pined for is now here. Tuberville doesn’t believe President Joe Biden cares about any of this, “Don’t expect any type of actual immigration reform from this Administration…they just want the American people to think they’re trying.”\n1. To highlight how unserious Democrats are about this issue, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says he believes that climate change is driving the situation at the border. This was in response to a question from MSNBC that asked, “Border Patrol, in the month of December, processed more migrants entering the United States illegally than any month in the history of that agency.

        "text": "Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz\nThere is a lot to be angry about.\nOur political systems are dysfunctional and rife with hateful rhetoric. Headlines about multiple wars abroad are competing for our attention, while at home, we are fighting ideological wars for our basic rights or to protect our communities. A devastating pandemic is grinding through a fourth year. A culture of consumerism often saps power and resources from a huge number of workers and consumers. Climate change threatens ever-growing destruction. There is so much hate and violence.\nAnd that’s just what’s in the news!\nYou might be angry about entirely personal things. Coping with work. Coping with a lack of work. Handling family relationships. Seeking family relationships. Managing illness. Or you could be carrying anger about past trauma.\nIf you are angry, you probably have good reason, and you definitely are not alone in that feeling.\nThis new year, let’s all think about anger as we are making resolutions. I reflect a lot on the moral development of our society based on my doctorate in developmental psychology from Columbia University in New York — which some might call the anger capital of the world! I lived for some years in the Holy Land, a place where we often can find a lot of holy rage. I am a rabbi in Arizona, one of the most politically divided states in our nation, situated on the border with Mexico. I am also a mentor to young people working to become activists and devote their energies to fighting, often with a lot of anger, for a better future.\nAnd to my mentees, to my community members, to myself and to you, I want to say: Let’s work on managing our anger in 2024.\nHere are the three ideas I want you to have in mind.\n- Your anger is a risk to you (and to others). If you give it free expression, you may feel it is right; you may be sure it is justified. And maybe it is. But it can cost you relationships, it can impede your functioning, and it can degrade your health.\nSome people have gotten the idea that the best way to relieve difficult emotions is to “let them out,” like joining a fight club to get rid of anger. But here’s the thing: Sometimes expressing emotions can reinforce them instead. Storming with rage can lead to more rage.\nI suspect people are overcompensating for another big mistake — repressing anger in the hope that it will disappear.\nThere is so much anger, and the stakes are so high with what we do with it.\nI see this over and over again with young activists who are living their lives, minute to minute, dominated by their sense of anger. People have treated them badly based on who they are. They hold onto those experiences, and then they feel that everyone they see hates them. They have good reason to be angry, but their anger has snowballed into rage that consumes them.\n- Your anger is wise. So what can you do, if expressing your anger is risky and repressing your anger is no better? Relate to it. Befriend it. Let it go, but not before it teaches you something about yourself or about the world. Try to understand it.\nThis is what I teach my mentees when they feel their anger demonstrates that their commitment is more valid or authentic. Ask your anger about the hurt from which it is truly coming and then look for ways to address that hurt. Your anger is your partner, not your nemesis, in this spiritual investigation.\nAnd when we have shown it respect and addressed some of its needs — we don’t need to solve them all, just attend to them — it is also easier to thank our anger for showing up to support us and telling it, “I don’t need you right now,” when it gets in our way.\nI hear of too many people who take on roles of guidance around handling emotions — and then simply validate the person’s emotions and go no further. Parenting, teaching and mentoring are about more than just validating complex emotions. I can validate emotions and bear witness to a person’s infinite value as a human — and still gently push them to constantly grow and actively improve their relationships with their emotions. And I also model how I do so myself. I certainly count on others to push me in my own growth.\n- Your anger is powerful. Not only can you learn from your anger, but also, the state of being angry can serve you.\nResearchers at Texas A&M University recently published a research paper titled “Anger Has Benefits for Attaining Goals.” They conducted a series of experiments showing that anger can boost performance and/or motivation to achieve goals. Can we productively engage our anger to be more of service to our employers, families, and communities? Can we animate our anger, in generative ways, to bring our emotional life at large to life so we avoid becoming cynical, stoic, apathetic, or indifferent to the emotional roller coasters of life?\nManaging your anger is not about destroying it. You are going through life together, and you should be in charge, benefiting from its wisdom and its strength, but you should not be controlled by it.\nHere’s to a year of healthy, productive, limited anger.\nLet’s bring more light than heat into 2024.\nRabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz is the author of two dozen books on Jewish ethics.",

        "text": '- Lawmakers in Washington state are scheduled to meet for a legislative session focusing on housing, climate change and the fentanyl crisis.\n- The 60-day session will involve numerous bills and approval of a supplemental budget based on Gov. Jay Inslee\'s proposal.\n- Key proposals include addressing the housing crisis through bills mandating affordable units in transit hub housing and rent stabilization.\nLawmakers in Washington state will return to Olympia on Monday to address housing, climate change and the fentanyl crisis in an abbreviated legislative session that marks Jay Inslee’s final one as governor.\nDuring a session preview this week, the Democratic governor described climate as the biggest long-term issue he wants to address this session. He referenced his six grandchildren and his fear about what the environment will look like when they\'re his age.\n"I am going to do everything I can in the next 60 days to make sure we have a brighter vision for everybody’s grandkids," he said.\nGOV. JAY INSLEE WON\'T SEEK RE-ELECTION, ENDING SPECULATION OVER UNPRECEDENTED 4TH TERM\nMajority Democrats will also be playing defense. A conservative group has submitted hundreds of thousands of signatures in support of initiatives that threaten some of their biggest recent wins, including the 1-year-old Climate Commitment Act, a landmark policy that created a "cap and invest" system for carbon emissions. The initiatives have been provisionally certified and will end up on the November ballot, Democratic House Speaker Laurie Jinkins said.\n"I do look forward to the conversation with Washington voters ... I don\'t think the voters in this state particularly want to turn our backs on climate change," she said.\nThe 60-day election-year session will feature hundreds of bills and see lawmakers approve a supplemental budget based on a proposal by Inslee. Democrats control the House by a margin of 58-40 and the Senate by 29-20.\nHere are some key proposals that will be considered:\nHOUSING\nAfter a 2023 legislative session filled with proposals to address the housing crisis, lawmakers are once more facing off against staggeringly high home and rental prices.\nOne bill would require that 10% of the units in new housing around transit hubs, including bus rapid transit and light rail, be affordable for lower income residents. Another would focus on rent stabilization, barring landlords from increasing rent by more than 5% annually during a rental agreement term.\nDemocratic Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who is sponsoring both proposals, called the rental market "untenable."\n"People are having to make decisions about whether they buy food or whether they pay rent," she said. "And that’s not a society I think any of us want to live in."\nHouse Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, a Republican, said the focus should be on increasing the supply of housing, referencing a proposal that would provide additional property tax credits for builders to add affordable multi-family housing.\n"The biggest and maybe the only thing we can really meaningfully do is grow the supply of housing stock," he said. "We need more housing, period. Housing of all types."\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nLawmakers on both sides are proposing legislation related to the Climate Commitment Act, which works to cap and reduce climate pollution while creating revenue for climate investments. It includes quarterly auctions in which emission allowances are sold to businesses covered under the act, and they raised $1.8 billion dollars in 2023, according to the Department of Ecology.\nSome Democratic lawmakers are pushing to increase transparency surrounding oil prices in the face of high gas prices and complaints that the climate act is to blame.\nOthers want to link the carbon market with California and Quebec — which also have emission allowance auctions — so the auctions of emission allowances would include all three jurisdictions.\nAt the same time, Republican lawmakers have proposed requiring that utility companies list on bills charges resulting from the climate act.\nOutside of the climate act, there will be efforts to electrify school buses statewide and a push to make tires more efficient so vehicles get better mileage.\n"It makes the program more durable and stable, and provides more opportunities for the market to do what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide investments for us to invest in non-fossil economies," said state Rep. Beth Doglio, chair of the House Environment & Energy Committee.\nDRUGS\nAs overdose deaths rise in Washington, some lawmakers are doubling down on the fight against fentanyl by proposing legislation that would increase access to opioid overdose reversal medications and education.\nBLUE STATE\'S $143 MILLION HOMELESS PROGRAM GOT LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE HOUSED\nOne bill would require all school districts make naloxone available in high schools, instead of only districts with at least 2,000 students. Another proposal would help bring information about fentanyl into K-12 public schools.\n"It has become a significant problem in our society. It’s incredibly powerful and it’s being mixed with everything and it’s very available," said Democratic Sen. Lisa Wellman, of Mercer Island, who sponsored the bill.\nLast year, there were more than 1,000 fentanyl overdose deaths in King County, which includes Seattle, according to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.\nThe work comes less than eight months after the state approved a major new drug policy that keeps controlled substances illegal while boosting resources to help those struggling with addiction.',

John Bel Edwards announced Thursday his forthcoming employment by a New Orleans-based law firm.\n- Edwards, who leaves office on Jan. 8, will assume a special counsel position with Fishman Haygood LLP.\n- "I look forward to rejoining the legal profession and continuing to serve the state by establishing Louisiana as a leader in green energy while maintaining our commercial competitiveness," Edwards said in a news release.\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that once he leaves office next week he will join a New Orleans-based law firm where he will focus on renewable energy litigation.\nDuring Edwards\' past two terms as governor, which has spanned eight years, the Democrat has prioritized developing and expanding Louisiana\'s renewable energy sources and reducing the state\'s carbon dioxide emissions. Before entering the political world, Edwards, who was unable to run for governor again because of consecutive term limits, was a trial attorney who had opened a civil law practice in his hometown of Amite.\n"It has been the greatest honor of my lifetime to serve as governor of the State of Louisiana," Edwards said in a news release Thursday. "I look forward to rejoining the legal profession and continuing to serve the state by establishing Louisiana as a leader in green energy while maintaining our commercial competitiveness."\nOUTGOING LOUISIANA GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS PARDONS 56 INMATES, INCLUDING 40 CONVICTED MURDERERS\nEdwards will join Fishman Haygood LLP as special counsel when he leaves office on Jan. 8. He will work with the law firm’s business and litigation teams.\n"We are thrilled to have the governor join our team," John Werner, a partner of Fishman Haygood, said in a statement. "John Bel has been a proven leader throughout his life, including his recent efforts to grow the renewable energy sector in Louisiana. We are excited that he has chosen to join us in this next phase of his career."\nThe law firm, which was founded in 1996, has been involved in negotiating complex land deals and corporate mergers as well as high-profile cases like the Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme and the BP Deepwater Horizon settlement, The Advocate reported.\nOver the past two decades, Louisiana has had a front-row seat to the effects of climate change, with hurricanes making landfall more frequently, coastal areas being eaten away by erosion, subsidence and rising sea levels, and the Mississippi River reaching record-low water levels, causing barges with agricultural exports to get stuck.

        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis and state administrators have rejected at least $11 billion in federal funds in the past few years, saying there were strings attached, they “politicized” roads or fought climate change.\nThe programs affected include an expansion of Medicaid, rebates for energy-saving appliances and upgrades, a program to cut motor vehicle emissions, and summer lunches for children from low-income families. Millions of mostly low-income Floridians could have benefited from the funding, the governor’s critics say.\nAs the Legislature convenes on Tuesday to build next year’s state budget, federal COVID-19 recovery funds that have fueled tax cuts, road projects and padded the state’s $10 billion rainy day fund are drying up. State economists warn of a slowdown in tax revenue over the next few years.\nAt the same time, DeSantis continues campaigning for the Republican nomination for president by railing against the federal government’s spending. He also says he wants to plow several billion more dollars into the state’s ample reserves, despite no recession in sight.\nDemocrats say they believe the governor’s main goal is to target President Joe Biden.\n“It’s so painful to watch as DeSantis turns people into political talking points against the Biden administration,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said. “He’ll do it regardless of how it hurts his constituents in Florida. And since he has no logical reason for rejecting those funds, it must be political.”\nBut DeSantis does take federal funding for the programs he wants. About one of every three dollars in the $114 billion budget he recommended to the Legislature comes from federal coffers.\n“He’s happy to take federal funds for police officer bonuses or … to score political points,” Driskell said. “But there is no real nuance to why he rejects so many funds that would help Floridians and take credit for that, too. He just wants to draw a distinction between himself and Biden.”\nDeSantis Press Secretary Jeremy Redfern has said that the governor has the right to veto or turn down programs he considers to be bad policy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks — sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation and concert tickets among them — cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”",

        "text": "Seventy-five percent of Maine’s native plants and animals are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As temperatures warm, threatened species will have to move to survive, but too often development makes this impossible. “The most iconic one that comes to mind is moose,” says Jeremy Gabrielson, senior conservation and community planner for Maine Coast Heritage Trust. “When I was in high school, I regularly saw moose in Cape Elizabeth, but that’s far less common now.” Local housing development alone doesn’t explain their absence; rather, widespread habitat fragmentation has stopped the animals from traveling long distances. “A moose thinks twice before it crosses a roadway,” Gabrielson says. “If you put enough obstacles in its way that make it think twice, it just won’t continue.”\nWhile species like moose and bobcats have a large home range, smaller species also need to move around. A breeding population of pine martens, nocturnal mammals that live in conifer-dominated forests, can exist on a single piece of land, but in order to maintain that population, the offspring must go elsewhere. “With a lot of the mammals we have in Maine, the young will travel to a new area to find a mate,” Gabrielson says. Amphibians, also common in Maine, breed in vernal pools and then spend time in the nearby upland. “They don’t necessarily go far,” Gabrielson says, “but a road between the place where they breed and the landscape where they will live as adults can have a serious, detrimental impact.”\nMaine Coast Heritage Trust is working to strategically preserve and connect large blocks of land to ensure enough habitat for animal populations to live out their lives. The resulting expansive corridors not only support Maine’s flora and fauna, but also benefit humans who enjoy the solace of open and undeveloped space.\nVisit these MCHT preserves to look for signs of resident wildlife this winter!\nLocated in Brunswick, this 87.5-acre preserve invites visitors to explore its trails in search of wildlife and picturesque scenes of northern Casco Bay.\nLook for these tracks: Bobcat, coyote, otter, and porcupine\nThis former Rockport dairy farm features a 1.8-mile trail and gardens where young people grow food for the community.\nLook for these tracks: Bobcat, coyote, fisher, and porcupine\nFeaturing nearly 6 miles of lakeshore and 3,057 acres in Whiting, this wildlife-rich preserve is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts throughout the year.\nLook for these tracks: Coyote, fisher, otter, and porcupine\nLocated in Castine, Witherle Woods has a rich military history, offers pleasant views of Penobscot Bay, and features groomed cross-country-skiing trails.\nLook for these tracks: Bobcat, coyote, fisher, and porcupine\nDownload a free take-along tracking guide chock-full of information about the animals found in Maine’s coastal forests!",

        "text": "Wet snow pelts my face and pulls against my skis as I climb above 8,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California, tugging a sled loaded with batteries, bolts, wire and 40 pounds of sunflower seeds critical to our mountain chickadee research.\nAs we reach the remote research site, I duck under a tarp and open a laptop. A chorus of identification numbers are shouted back and forth as fellow behavioral ecologist Vladimir Pravosudov and I program “smart” bird feeders for an upcoming experiment.\nI have spent the past six years monitoring a population of mountain chickadees here, tracking their life cycles and, importantly, their memory, working in a system Pravosudov established in 2013. The long, consistent record from this research site has allowed us to observe how chickadees survive in extreme winter snowfall and to identify ecological patterns and changes.\nIn recent history, intense winters are often followed by drought years here in the Sierra Nevada and in much of the U.S. West. This teeter-totter pattern has been identified as one of the unexpected symptoms of climate change, and its impact on the chickadees is providing an early warning of the disruptions ahead for the dynamics within these coniferous forest ecosystems.\nOur research shows that a mountain chickadee facing deep snow is, to borrow a cliche, like a canary in a coal mine – its survivability tells us about the challenges ahead.\nAs Pravosudov calls out the next identification number, and as my legs slowly get colder and wetter, a charming and chipper “DEE DEE DEE” chimes down from a nearby tree. How is it that a bird weighing barely more than a few sheets of paper is more comfortable in this storm than I am?\nThe answer comes down to the chickadees’ incredible spatial cognitive abilities.\nCognition is the processes by which animals acquire, process, store and act on information from their environment. It is critical to many species but is often subtle and difficult to measure in nonhuman animals.\nChickadees are food-storing specialists that hide tens of thousands of individual food items throughout the forest under edges of tree bark, or even between pine needles, each fall. Then, they use their specialized spatial memory to retrieve those food caches in the months to come.\nConditions in the high Sierras can be harsh, and if chickadees can’t remember where their food is, they die.\nWe measure the spatial memory of chickadees using a classic associative learning task but in a very atypical location. To do this, we hang a circular array of eight feeders equipped with radio-frequency identification and filled with seed in several locations across our field site. Birds are tagged with “keys” – transponder tags in leg bands that contain individual identification numbers and allow them to open the doors of their assigned feeders to get a food reward.\nThe setup allows us to measure the spatial memory performance of individual chickadees, because they have to remember which feeder their key enables them to open. Over eight years, our findings demonstrate that chickadees with better spatial memory ability are more likely to survive in the high mountains than those with worse memories.\nHowever, chickadees may be facing increasing challenges that will shape their future in the high mountains. In 2017, a year with record-breaking snow levels, adult chickadees showed the lowest probability of survival ever measured at our site. This exceptionally extreme winter came with recurrent storms containing cold weather and high winds, making it difficult for even the memory savvy chickadees to forage and survive.\nNevertheless, triumphant populations have persisted in high-elevation mountain environments, but their future is becoming uncertain.\n“It’s weather whiplash,” says Adrian Harpold, a mountain ecohydrologist. Harpold works to understand variations in climate patterns within forest environments, and one of his field sites lies alongside our chickadee research site.\nThe Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in western North America have been experiencing more extreme snow years and drought years, amplified by climate change. Extreme snow linked to global warming might seem counterintuitive, but it’s basic physics. Warmer air can hold more moisture – about 7% more for every degree Celsius (every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) that temperatures rise. This can result in heavier snowfall when storms strike.\nIn 2023’s record winter, over 17 feet (5 meters) of snow covered the landscape that our chickadees were using every day. In fact, these intense storms and cold temperatures not only made it difficult for birds to survive the winter but made it almost impossible for them to breed the next summer: 46% of chickadee nests at our higher elevation site failed to produce any offspring. This was likely due to the deep snow that prevented them from finding emerging insects to feed nestlings or even reaching nesting sites at all until July.\nEven in years of tremendous snowfall, chickadees can still use their finely honed spatial memories to recover food. However, severe storms can shorten their survival odds. And if they do survive the winter, their nesting sites – tree cavities – may be buried under feet of snow in the spring.\nIt doesn’t matter how smart you are if you can’t reach your nest.\nExtreme snow oscillations also affect insects that are critical for feeding chickadee chicks. Limited resources lead to smaller chickadee offspring that are less likely to survive high in the mountains.\nSnow cover is good for overwintering insects in most cases, as it provides an insulating blanket that saves them from dying during those freezing months. However, if the snow persists too long into the summer, insects can run out of energy and die before they can emerge, or emerge after chickadees really need them. Drought years also can drive insect population decline.\nExtremes at both ends of the spectrum are making it harder for chickadees to thrive, and more and more we are seeing oscillations between these extremes.\nThese compounded effects mean that in some years chickadees simply don’t successfully nest at all. This leads to a decline in chickadee populations in years with worse whiplash – drought followed by high snow on repeat – especially at high elevations. This is especially concerning, as many mountain-dwelling avian species are forecasted to move up in elevation to escape warming temperatures, which may turn out to be hazardous.\nChickadees may be portrayed as radiating tranquil beauty on holiday cards, but realistically, these loud, round ruffians are tough survivors of harsh winter environments in northern latitudes.\nOur long-term research following these chickadees provides a unique window into the relationships between winter snow, chickadee populations and the biological community around them, such as coniferous forests and insect populations.\nThese relationships illustrate that climate change is a more complicated story than just the temperature climb – and that its whiplash and cascading effects can destabilize ecosystems.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.\nRead more:\nBenjamin Sonnenberg receives funding from the National Science Foundation.",

        "text": "In this week's Around Town column, read about recognition for departing Palo Alto Mayor Lydia Kou, changes to the city's parks and what Palo Alto residents want in 2024.\nPARTING WORDS … After a year in the central chair, Palo Alto Mayor Lydia Kou is set to relinquish her leadership position on Jan. 8, the City Council's first meeting of the new year. If the city's loosely held tradition holds, the council the title will shift to Vice Mayor Greer Stone. It will then hold an election amongst its members to determine its vice mayor for 2024, an exercise that typically provides the only moment of suspense in the largely ceremonial meeting. And in yet another local tradition, the first act of the reorganized City Council will be to pass a resolution thanking Kou for her service as mayor. Kou is known around the region for being a feisty foe of Sacramento housing mandates and streamlined-approval laws. The resolution acknowledges this by calling her \"a staunch advocate for local control of planning and development, opposing state legislation that could erode Palo Alto's quality of life and environment.\" It also recognizes her for her work on several local committees, including ones dealing with the future of the Cubberley Community Center and the former Fry's Electronics site, and on regional bodies such as the Cities Association of Santa Clara County. \"Lydia's tenure as Mayor exemplifies her integrity, passion and dedication toward the betterment of Palo Alto, its residents and its business community,\" the resolution reads.\nWHEN NATURE CALLS … Palo Alto has big ambitions when it comes to sprucing up its already popular parks and open space preserves. In the next year, the city plans to implement various safety improvements at Foothills Park to make it safer for pedestrians; fix up the damaged piling at the Baylands boardwalk; and enhance Seale Park by adding pathways, picnic tables and new playground equipment. But there is one particular and often overlooked park amenity that is quietly enjoying a renaissance in Palo Alto: the park bathroom. According to a newly released capital improvement plan, the city plans to move ahead in the next year with constructing bathrooms at Cubberley Community Center, Ramos Park and at Boulware Park, a Ventura neighborhood park that is now being expanded and enhanced. The city also plans to kick off the design process in the coming year for a new bathroom at the Magical Bridge playground in Mitchell Park. It wasn't always like this. In 2014, neighbors of Eleanor Pardee Park defeated a proposal to install a bathroom in their park, arguing that it would attract unwanted visitors. A similar argument – and outcome – took place at Johnson Park in 1994. The new bathrooms aren't facing any such opposition. During a recent Parks and Recreation Commission meeting, Chair Jeff Greenfield said that ideally the city would build a park bathroom every other year. Lam Do, superintendent of open space, parks and golf in the Community Services Department, cited insufficient funding to do so. Other projects on the preliminary list of improvements include new picnic areas, pathways and irrigation (and, yes, a remodeled restroom) at Rinconada Park. Robles Park would see improved pathways and resurfaced play areas. The city also plans to begin design work for Seale Park in Old Palo Alto, which includes new playground equipment, picnic tables, fencing and pathways. Heritage Park and Peers Park will also see playground updates and new benches, according to the plan.\nNEW YEAR, NEW GOALS … When the City Council assembles for its annual retreat on Jan. 29, one of its key tasks will be to select annual priorities for 2024. To that end, the city has been surveying residents over the past few weeks to get their take on this topic. While the survey results are yet to be tallied, a cursory look through the preliminary survey findings suggest that affordable housing remains a top concern for many residents. Southgate resident Baq Haidiri said in the survey that the council's goal should be \"adding more affordable housing to make it more vibrant and accessible to a diversity of people and reduce climate change from commuting,\" a sentiment shared by dozens of similar comments in the survey (which is now closed). Some residents suggested prioritizing bike improvements, free high-speed Internet access, airplane noise and climate change. Thomas Rindfleisch, a Crescent Park resident, made a pitch for flood protection around the San Francisquito Creek. \"There is no perfect solution that will protect all creek-influenced residents from all future floods, especially in the face of increasing climate change effects,\" he wrote. \"However, there are ways to reduce the risk for all creek residents substantially.\"",

        "text": "California may be running out of time with a friendly Washington\nA backlog of California policies is piling up at President Joe Biden’s EPA, raising fears that they won’t get approved before the election.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. — California is rushing to implement a sweeping array of climate change policies before a potential second Donald Trump presidency. But the state is running into a growing backlog of federal approvals for its nation-leading clean air rules.\nCalifornia’s new rule requiring trucking companies to buy increasing numbers of zero-emission vehicles was supposed to take effect Monday. Instead, companies learned last week they wouldn’t be penalized for noncompliance until the federal government grants California permission to enforce the measure.\nThe Golden State is waiting on Biden administration waivers for several high-priority climate and air pollution rules to set more-stringent emissions standards than national requirements. Ironically, in most cases, it’s the Democratic president’s Environmental Protection Agency that’s putting the deep blue state’s pioneering environmental policies at risk over what appear to be mere bureaucratic delays.\n“A Trump EPA is not going to give these waivers,” said Dan Sperling, a former member of the California Air Resources Board who directs the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. “Getting EPA to accelerate the granting of the waivers has to be a priority.”\nThe rule that the California Air Resources Board postponed last week would require large trucking fleets to use zero-emission vehicles by 2042. Other rules in EPA’s queue include emissions limits on lawn mowers, ferries, locomotives and refrigeration units on trucks and railcars.\nIndustry groups are closely watching how Biden’s EPA will handle the logjam, anticipating that federal regulators will try to clear their agenda before the possibility of a Trump takeover.\n“The political calculation in the Biden White House is going to be really interesting,” said Joe Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association, which represents small trucking companies and is suing over a pair of California emissions rules, including the truck-purchasing mandate. “Do they push EPA to grant the waiver before November, or do they wait till after the election?”\nSeveral of the rules have been at EPA for more than a year, and several more just entered the queue in November. Given that EPA generally takes at minimum six months but often over a year to act on waivers, the timeline is bumping up against the presidential election — and creating a new sense of urgency among environmentalists.\n“In my opinion, it’s not too early to panic,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.\nThe reason environmentalists are so worried about Trump is his administration’s shattering of norms in 2019, when EPA withdrew a waiver that the Obama administration had previously granted to enforce auto emissions standards. It was the first time an administration had attempted to revoke an existing waiver, and sent shock waves through California and the other 18 states that are signed on to follow its tailpipe emissions rules.\n“That was a huge deal politically,” said Mary Nichols, who served as CARB chair from the tail end of the George W. Bush administration through 2020.\nCalifornia’s waivers are now a perennial punching bag for congressional Republicans, who have taken aim at the state’s electric vehicle mandate and ban on gas-powered lawn equipment. And a group of red states, led by Ohio, is challenging the constitutionality of California’s unique authority to set stricter-than-federal air quality standards, in a case that could reach the Supreme Court.\nA former U.S. EPA scientist who worked at the agency during the Trump years said that not having the waivers in hand would make it still easier for a second Trump administration to prevent California from implementing its rules.\n“If the waivers haven’t been provided before a change of administration, they would immediately change direction on those waivers, and use any non-legal, non-scientific method to deny them, as they did in the previous administration,” said Matt Davis, who worked as an EPA health scientist from 2009-19 and now serves as legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.\nThe Trump campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nEPA officials said they didn’t have a timing estimate for any of the waiver requests. “With each of the waiver requests submitted by California, EPA must follow the process of a public comment period and final determination,” agency spokesperson Angela Hackel said in an email. “We have no timeline for when EPA will reach a final decision for these actions.”\nIt’s not clear that EPA is to blame for the entire backlog, although some of the waivers, like ones to approve emissions limits on lawn mowers, refrigerated truck units and ferries, have been sitting at the agency for more than a year. All of them have provisions that technically went into effect this week.\nIn the case of California’s truck rule, the air board only requested a waiver in November, well after it approved the regulation in April and only two months before it was supposed to take effect. That left EPA little room to approve the rule in time.\nThe state’s tight timeline and subsequent notice that it wouldn’t enforce the Advanced Clean Fleets rule may have been designed to draw EPA’s attention, Nichols said.\n“By sending this message out, they’re presumably trying to light a fire under all the people who support the ACF to make a fuss and get the EPA to expedite it,” she said.\nThe air board said its timing was focused on quickly reducing emissions.\n“CARB established the compliance requirements of the ACF regulation to ensure that that regulation will timely reduce the emissions from medium- and heavy-duty trucks that harm the public health and environment of Californians, in conjunction with other elements of California’s motor vehicle emissions control program,” CARB spokesperson Lys Mendez said in an email.\nOne of the reasons it might be taking EPA so long to approve other waivers is the agency’s habitual large workload and short staffing levels. “It wouldn’t surprise me if there’s still some staff capacity issues here and there,” Davis said.\nAnother reason is increased legal scrutiny and challenges from industry, which is going after California’s rules for locomotives, truck fleets and passenger car emissions.\n“The federal courts have become so hostile that I think perhaps EPA is being more cautious, because of the likelihood that they will be sued over waivers,” Magavern said.\nThere are some signs of movement. California asked EPA in June to approve a waiver for its Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which sets fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles and requires increasing percentages of zero-emission car sales. EPA last week took the first step in the process, scheduling a public hearing for Jan. 10.\nAn earlier version of this report first appeared in the California Climate newsletter.

        "text": "The economy is voters’ No. 1 issue for the third straight year, with 32% of those polled citing some economic issue that they think the Legislature should focus on when it convenes next week – even though lawmakers will have more cash to spend this session than expected, because the state’s new capital gains tax and carbon pricing system brought in over $1 billion more than forecasted.\nPollster Stuart Elway says the disconnect between personal finances and “the economy” also shows up in national polls, because talking about the economy writ large is more of a political issue than personal finances. Both the economy and public safety are expected to be prominent in the political debate this election season, even though most people have not had personal experiences with either economic hardship or crime.\n“Every time I have asked these questions since 1992 – 85 times – more people have been optimistic about their own household than for the country,” Elway said. But this time, the numbers are much more stark: a 26-point gap between optimism about people’s own household (60% chose this answer) and optimism about the country (chosen by 34%).\nThe latest Crosscut/Elway Poll was conducted between Dec. 26 and 28, with a mix of cell phone, landline, and online survey questions. It has a 5% margin of error at the 95% confidence level. That means that if the survey had been run 100 times, the results would be within five percentage points of these results in at least 95 of those scenarios.\nAnother way ideological disconnect showed up in this poll was in the priorities voters have for legislative action this session.\nIn one question, 57% said they would be in favor of repealing the state’s new capital gains tax. An initiative proposing that repeal will likely end up on the November ballot since lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Legislature are not expected to act on the idea. The 7% tax applies to profits from the sale of stocks and some other capital assets that exceed $250,000.\nIn another question, 55% said they were in favor of spending a state surplus from that same capital gains tax – as well as the new cap-and-invest program – to put more money into schools, reducing homelessness, mental health programs and combating the effects of climate change. The other choices on that question were putting money into reserves (chosen by 7%), or cutting taxes (chosen by 30%).\nElway said Washington voters have historically always told pollsters they are in favor of spending all the money coming into state government accounts rather than cutting taxes or putting it into reserves. But the political divide on these policy priority questions has grown over recent years.\n“Party identification has become such a determining factor, more than it has been for decades,” Elway said, noting several numbers in the poll to illustrate that point. Democrats strongly support spending more money on housing, while Republicans are largely opposed to the idea. A 56% majority of Republicans also said they favored cutting taxes, while only 10% of Democrats thought that was a good idea.\nWhile Republicans in Washington poll similar to Republicans everywhere on wanting to tax less and spend less, this poll illustrated less-monolithic feelings on the Democrat side to some of these questions. For example, Democrats were split on repealing the capital gains tax (44% for repealing, 39% against).\nHistorical polling data shows Washingtonians have had a love/hate relationship with taxing capital gains. In January 2015, 58% of voters polled supported a proposal to establish a capital gains tax. In January 2021, 54% of voters opposed such a tax.\nAnd in this survey, 57% favored repealing the capital gains tax, even though 84% wanted to put more money into mental health and drug programs; 75% wanted to give utility rebates to low- and middle-income households; and 66% want to spend more on housing programs.\nEvery year at this time, Crosscut asks voters what they think the Legislature should focus on. Those priorities have changed over time. For example, during the pandemic in 2021, dealing with COVID-19 was the top priority. Now it doesn’t even make the list generated by this open-ended question.\n“I guess COVID is over or people are through with the pandemic,” Elway said.\nVoters listed as their top priorities this year – and last – the economy, public safety, homelessness, taxes, government (including polarization, election security, democracy, less government and corruption), education and the environment.\nThe question on which voters from both parties were most decisive concerned government transparency and the state Public Records Act, which says state agency documents, including emails, should be available to the public. Some state lawmakers have been claiming something they call “legislative privilege,” exempting themselves from having to share some of their emails, texts and other communications when asked by the public or the media. But the Washington Supreme Court has ruled they are subject to the Public Records Act.\nVoters who answered the most recent Crosscut/Elway Poll were clear: 82% said lawmakers should comply with public disclosure laws, 9% said legislators should be exempt and 8% had no opinion.\nNext week, Crosscut will release the second half of its December/January poll, which will focus on voters’ opinions on the 2024 statewide election, including the race for governor.",

        "text": "Major cities on the U.S. Atlantic coast are sinking, in some cases as much as 5 millimeters per year – a decline at the ocean’s edge that well outpaces global sea level rise, confirms new research from Virginia Tech and the U.S. Geological Survey.\nParticularly hard hit population centers such as New York City and Long Island, Baltimore, and Virginia Beach and Norfolk are seeing areas of rapid “subsidence,” or sinking land, alongside more slowly sinking or relatively stable ground, increasing the risk to roadways, runways, building foundations, rail lines, and pipelines, according to a study published Jan. 2 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.\n“Continuous unmitigated subsidence on the U.S. East Coast should cause concern,” said lead author Leonard Ohenhen, a graduate student working with Associate Professor Manoochehr Shirzaei at Virginia Tech’s Earth Observation and Innovation Lab. “This is particularly in areas with a high population and property density and a historical complacency toward infrastructure maintenance.”\nShirzaei and his research team pulled together a vast collection of data points measured by space-based radar satellites and used this highly accurate information to build digital terrain maps that show exactly where sinking landscapes present risks to the health of vital infrastructure. Using the publicly available satellite imagery, Shirzaei and Ohenhen measured millions of occurrences of land subsidence spanning multiple years. They then created some of the world’s first high resolution depictions of the land subsidence.\nThese groundbreaking new maps show that a large area of the East Coast is sinking at least 2 mm per year, with several areas along the mid-Atlantic coast of up to 3,700 square kilometers, or more than 1,400 square miles, sinking more than 5 mm per year, more than the current 4 mm per year global rate of sea level rise.\n“We measured subsidence rates of 2 mm per year affecting more than 2 million people and 800,000 properties on the East Coast,” Shirzaei said. “We know to some extent that the land is sinking. Through this study, we highlight that sinking of the land is not an intangible threat. It affects you and I and everyone, it may be gradual, but the impacts are real.”\nIn several cities along the East Coast, multiple critical infrastructures such as roads, railways, airports, and levees are affected by differing subsidence rates.\n“Here, the problem is not just that the land is sinking. The problem is that the hotspots of sinking land intersect directly with population and infrastructure hubs,” said Ohenhen. “For example, significant areas of critical infrastructure in New York, including JFK and LaGuardia airports and its runways, along with the railway systems, are affected by subsidence rates exceeding 2 mm per year. The effects of these right now and into the future are potential damage to infrastructure and increased flood risks.”\nThe new findings appear in the open access journal PNAS Nexus. In the work “Slowly but surely: Exposure of communities and infrastructure to subsidence on the US east coast,” Virginia Tech and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists measured how much the land along the East Coast has sunk and which areas, populations, and critical infrastructure within 100 km of the coast are at risk of land subsidence. Subsidence can undermine building foundations; damage roads, gas, and water lines; cause building collapse; and exacerbate coastal flooding – especially when paired with sea level rise caused by climate change.\n“This information is needed. No one else is providing it,” said Patrick Barnard, a research geologist with the USGS and co-author of the study. “Shirzaei and his Virginia Tech team stepped into that niche with his technical expertise and is providing something extremely valuable.”",

        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis and state administrators have rejected at least $11 billion in federal funds in the past few years, saying there were strings attached, they “politicized” roads or fighting climate change.\nThe programs affected include an expansion of Medicaid, rebates for energy-saving appliances and upgrades, a program to cut motor vehicle emissions, and summer lunches for children from low-income families. Millions of mostly low-income Floridians could have benefited from the funding, the governor’s critics say.\nAs the Legislature convenes on Tuesday to build next year’s state budget, federal COVID-19 recovery funds that have fueled tax cuts, and road projects and padded the state’s $10 billion rainy day fund are drying up. State economists warn of a slowdown in tax revenue over the next few years.\nAt the same time, DeSantis continues campaigning for the Republican nomination for president by railing against the federal government’s spending. He also says he wants to plow several billion more dollars into the state’s ample reserves, despite no recession in sight.\nDemocrats say they believe the governor’s main goal is to target President Biden.\n“It’s so painful to watch as DeSantis turns people into political talking points against the Biden administration,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said. “He’ll do it regardless of how it hurts his constituents in Florida. And since he has no logical reason for rejecting those funds, it must be political.”\nBut DeSantis does take federal funding for the programs he wants. About one of every three dollars in the $114 billion budget he recommended to the Legislature comes from federal coffers.\n“He’s happy to take federal funds for police officer bonuses or … to score political points,” Driskell said. “But there is no real nuance to why he rejects so many funds that would help Floridians and take credit for that, too. He just wants to draw a distinction between himself and Biden.”\nDeSantis Press Secretary Jeremy Redfern has said that the governor has the right to veto or turn down programs he considers to be bad policy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks – sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation, and concert tickets among them – cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”\nSend questions/comments to the editors.",

        "text": "The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden more than a year ago, is a game-changing law that invests hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change and boost renewable energy.\nIt includes lucrative tax credits aimed at making it cheaper to produce clean hydrogen, which are expected to funnel more than $100 billion in taxpayer funds toward this nascent technology. As a fuel that releases only water vapor when burned, hydrogen is a promising tool to slash emissions from industries that will be harder to clean up through electrification, such as steel, cement, aviation and long-distance trucking.\nBut the climate benefits of hydrogen evaporate if they are made with fossil fuels. That’s why it’s important that federal officials ensure the most valuable incentives only support truly “green” hydrogen projects that do not add to carbon emissions. And it’s why it was something of a relief to see the Biden administration release unexpectedly stringent rules last month requiring that hydrogen projects meet rigorous life-cycle emissions standards to qualify for the most generous tax credits.\nIt’s much cheaper to produce hydrogen with methane, a highly polluting fossil fuel, than with electricity. These subsidies are designed to upend those economics by making hydrogen produced with renewable energy cost-competitive.\nClean hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules using massive amounts of electricity. These power-hungry projects can hog clean energy from other users and actually drive up consumption of fossil fuels.\nTo avoid this, environmentalists pushed to have hydrogen projects meet strict requirements to be eligible for the most generous tax credits of $3 per kilogram of “clean” hydrogen – including being powered by additional sources of zero-emissions electricity, such as wind and solar; being generated at the same time of day as the water-splitting equipment is operating; and being deliverable within the same region where the hydrogen is produced.\nThe Treasury Department standards released last month largely adhere to these principles, to the delight of environmentalists and the consternation of business groups, which pushed for laxer requirements, and fossil-fuel-friendly politicians like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III. There are details yet to be worked out, but federal officials are on the right track.\nCalifornia has much at stake because the Biden administration selected the state as one of seven regional “clean hydrogen hubs’’ across the country that will receive $7 billion in federal infrastructure funding. So it’s disappointing that the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, the state-led public-private consortium behind California’s hydrogen hub plan, was among the groups advocating against the tighter standards on the grounds that they would be too onerous and put clean hydrogen at a disadvantage compared with other technologies.\nBeing strict about what counts as green and clean is the right thing to do for the climate, as is reserving the greatest incentives to hydrogen production that actually reduces planet-warming emissions. Consumer advocates also have appropriately emphasized that such guidelines are needed to protect regular people from rising electricity rates that could result from hydrogen projects diverting power from existing renewable energy sources.\nClean hydrogen is still in its infancy, and state and federal leaders should monitor how these incentives are helping to grow a sustainable industry. We can’t afford to squander tens of billions of federal climate funding on projects with questionable environmental effects.\nSend questions/comments to the editors.",

        "text": "Holidays often bring together family who see each other occasionally. And, many find, taking a walk’s a fine way to catch up on news and hear plans.\nWalking side by side dials down the intensity of a conversation by affording it time, motion and only the occasional side-glance, so different from the direct pressure of the face-to-face. Thought develops at a strolling pace. Just so recently, when our nephews joined us for a few days, which featured also a mild and windless stretch of possible weathers. That sent us to the easy walking of Pennellville, where we set out from and returned to the point of public land called Simpson’s.\nAlong the lightly traveled route, I was walking and talking with Rolando, who will graduate from college in May, and so is full of the future — interviews, locations, horizons. Rolando has the pleasing and rare quality of asking lots of questions and listening carefully to return thoughts. Another rarity: he’s a centrist; he wants to find a place where people can agree.\n“So,” he said, “what do you think about climate change?” I looked over to assess just how much he wanted in answer. I have a lot of thoughts, enough to wear the paint off someone’s attention span. True to his nature, he seemed ready to listen. Then, he added, “I’m curious because a lot of my friends think it’s just a natural change.” Where to begin?\nAs I mulled this, I was taken back to the Dec. 4 meeting of Brunswick’s town council. In the early evening, I tuned into our local cable channel, awaiting the advertised public discussion of our town’s Climate Change Task Force’s recommended targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That meeting, which ran deep into the evening, has been amply reported; it won’t fit into this column. But a few impressions from it can, and they made my conversation with Rolando more interesting.\nBrunswick’s task force outlined its recommendation that the town adopt targets that are more aggressive than those set out by the state in 2019 under the banner of Maine Won’t Wait. That initiative aimed 45% reduction of emissions by 2030 and 80% reduction of emissions by 2050. The Task Force hopes for targets of 65% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. These targets speak to the urgency that task force members feel.\nThe meeting’s focus then shifted to the public, to us. What did we think? Anyone wanting to offer comment had three minutes to do so. As the three-minute blocks (many of which were tested for elasticity) crept on, it occurred to me that I was witness to a microcosm of our country’s current convictions and moods. The speakers brought to the microphone opinions about a problem so large as to be a full atmosphere. Did this huge question fit into three minutes? And the answer was, is, of course not.\nBut what did fit into this small envelope of time were the feelings about the Climate “Crisis,” or “crisis,” brought to the surface. “It’s a complete hoax,” said one early speaker, who was replaced by another who said, “The science is settled,” and that it is on us to respond and mitigate climate change.\nStrung between those two poles was a wire of waypoints tending toward one pole or the other. A majority of speakers favored the aspirational targets recommended by the task force. Another smaller but vocal group, not so much. A few from that minority led with their chins, daring the governmental “them” to try to take away their freedoms, or diesel engines.\nOne climate change doubter offered a point that I think could have been be explored in an effort to find some sort of shared ground. “20,000 years ago,” he began, “this spot was covered by a mile of ice. So climate does change,” and he went on to argue that it is foolish to try to change the climate’s mind (my phrasing).\nThe speaker was, of course, right about the old ice. Any reading of the climate record over time points to recurrent, large changes — ice ages and meltings, with attendant sea-level decline and rise, e.g. But what spawned these climate changes and how each played forward asks deeper and deeper study.\nI emerge from this memory tour and look over to my nephew. I allot myself 3 minutes and offer him this:\nWe agree that the ice age (most recent of many) was about as different and uninhabitable as one could imagine. No science can unsettle that. But here’s the next point: it is also indisputable that carbon dioxide levels are higher now than they have been in the years since we adopted our habit of burning large stores of fossil fuels, adding a large X-factor that has stimulated this rise.\nWhich leads to this question for us: Why would we want to add volatility to a climate that is already changeable? And further, why would we want to do this over a short time frame, which is likely to provoke a shift that will be abrupt? Then, life as it is formed and pursued now would have very little time to adapt.\nThat, to my mind, is an interesting framing that we can talk over; that, perhaps, Rolando can talk over with his friends. It begins with a point of acceptance on each side, a way to set out when so much is unsettled.\nSandy Stott is a Brunswick, Maine resident, chair of the town’s Conservation Commission, and a member of Brunswick Topsham Land Trust’s Board of Directors.

        "text": "Robert Chang tasted a truffle for the first time at a trattoria in Germany — and it changed his life.\nToday, as chief truffle officer at the American Truffle Company, Chang works with scientist Paul Thomas and clients around the country to plant oak and hazelnut orchards with a goal of getting black truffles to grow beneath the trees. And the company hosts the annual Napa Truffle Festival — this year’s will be Jan. 12-15 — which offers educational talks as well as a series of truffle-loaded meals sure to make foodies swoon.\nChang recently chatted with us about what it takes to grow truffles outside Europe — and why sharp-nosed dogs are now preferred over truffle-hunting pigs.\nQ. I know you’re a Stanford alum and Silicon Valley engineer. What’s your truffle backstory?\nA. I love learning languages and had always wanted to learn German, so I applied to a fellowship organized by the Bosch Foundation. That’s where I had my first truffle experience — in a little mom-and-pop Italian trattoria in the middle of Munich. It was a very simple dish: a tagliatelle pasta tossed in butter with fresh black truffle shaved on top. I was immediately blown away. It was love at first bite.\nComing back to Silicon Valley, I began to wonder if you can grow it. There are plenty of people who claim to be able to grow truffles, but when I looked under the hoods, there was no science. I eventually found one guy who really had the science: Dr. Paul Thomas. He’s British. We really hit it off. Eventually, he asked me to become his business partner and start and run the North American operation to provide the scientific knowledge and expertise to help people grow truffles in North America. Paul and I co-founded the American Truffle Company back in 2007. Over the years, we’ve helped people establish many truffle orchards in California and across the country.\nQ. What does it take to cultivate truffles in California?\nA. We’ve had quite a bit of success with producing truffles. Our first harvest was in 2019 and last season, we harvested a lot of truffles from an orchard in Napa County.\nIf you were to try to grow truffles in their natural habitats in Europe, there’s relatively little science needed. But outside their natural habitat, it requires a tremendous amount of science to get the conditions right — the soil, the climate and even the organisms in the soil are very, very different. In general, the ideal climate is something close to Mediterranean — summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold.\nOver 90 percent of the of the soil types I’ve seen in the U.S. can, in fact, support truffles. Typically, it takes six to 12 months to prepare the soil. The first harvest is five to seven years after you plant the trees. Once you start producing, you can expect truffles every year for the next 40 to 60 years, if you manage the the orchard property.\nQ. What’s driving the growing interest in truffles?\nA. It’s driven by two factors: Demand has been skyrocketing. The demand has always outstripped the supply, (but) in the last five years, truffles have gotten more well-known in popular culture. Second, the scientific approach to growing truffles is having success. If you try to grow truffles (here) without access to science, the failure rate has been more than 98 percent.\nQ. Do you use dogs or pigs to find the truffles?\nA. Traditionally, in Europe, people have used pigs, but nowadays, that’s more for show. Trained dogs are a lot easier to transport and control. The truffles are actually underground. When a truffle is ripe, it starts giving off a characteristic aroma. You need a dog to tell you exactly where to dig.\nQ. What else should people know about truffles?\nA. First: Anytime you use truffle products or order something truffle flavored, unless you actually see individual pieces of truffle, it’s very likely made with truffle oil. Second: Truffles are the most lucrative legal crops you can grow. Third: Climate change (means) the native habitats of Europe will no longer be sustainable for truffles within about 30 years. You’ll see is production shifting away to other parts of the world, including North America.\nQ. What can you tell me about the upcoming Napa Truffle Festival?\nA. On the first day, we have an in-depth seminar on the business and science of truffles, and then the rest of the weekend is for the foodies. Typically, we have winery lunches at two different wineries. This year, they’re at Bouchaine Vineyards and Donum Estate. There is a signature truffle and wine dinner on Saturday night, when we invite Michelin star chefs to each prepare a course to showcase the best of truffle cuisine. It’s a really over-the-top truffle dinner paired with the best wines.\nDetails: The 2024 Napa Truffle Festival runs Jan. 12-15 at various Wine Country venues. Admission to the Truffle Festival Marketplace at Oxbow Public Market is free; other events range from $105 to $525. Find more information at napatrufflefestival.com.",

        "text": "Wet snow pelts my face and pulls against my skis as I climb above 8,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California, tugging a sled loaded with batteries, bolts, wire and 40 pounds of sunflower seeds critical to our mountain chickadee research.\nAs we reach the remote research site, I duck under a tarp and open a laptop. A chorus of identification numbers are shouted back and forth as fellow behavioral ecologist Vladimir Pravosudov and I program “smart” bird feeders for an upcoming experiment.\nI have spent the past six years monitoring a population of mountain chickadees here, tracking their life cycles and, importantly, their memory, working in a system Pravosudov established in 2013. The long, consistent record from this research site has allowed us to observe how chickadees survive in extreme winter snowfall and to identify ecological patterns and changes.\nIn recent history, intense winters are often followed by drought years here in the Sierra Nevada and in much of the U.S. West. This teeter-totter pattern has been identified as one of the unexpected symptoms of climate change, and its impact on the chickadees is providing an early warning of the disruptions ahead for the dynamics within these coniferous forest ecosystems.\nOur research shows that a mountain chickadee facing deep snow is, to borrow a cliche, like a canary in a coal mine – its survivability tells us about the challenges ahead.\nAs Pravosudov calls out the next identification number, and as my legs slowly get colder and wetter, a charming and chipper “DEE DEE DEE” chimes down from a nearby tree. How is it that a bird weighing barely more than a few sheets of paper is more comfortable in this storm than I am?\nThe answer comes down to the chickadees’ incredible spatial cognitive abilities.\nCognition is the processes by which animals acquire, process, store and act on information from their environment. It is critical to many species but is often subtle and difficult to measure in nonhuman animals.\nChickadees are food-storing specialists that hide tens of thousands of individual food items throughout the forest under edges of tree bark, or even between pine needles, each fall. Then, they use their specialized spatial memory to retrieve those food caches in the months to come.\nConditions in the high Sierras can be harsh, and if chickadees can’t remember where their food is, they die.\nWe measure the spatial memory of chickadees using a classic associative learning task but in a very atypical location. To do this, we hang a circular array of eight feeders equipped with radio-frequency identification and filled with seed in several locations across our field site. Birds are tagged with “keys” – transponder tags in leg bands that contain individual identification numbers and allow them to open the doors of their assigned feeders to get a food reward.\nThe setup allows us to measure the spatial memory performance of individual chickadees, because they have to remember which feeder their key enables them to open. Over eight years, our findings demonstrate that chickadees with better spatial memory ability are more likely to survive in the high mountains than those with worse memories.\nHowever, chickadees may be facing increasing challenges that will shape their future in the high mountains. In 2017, a year with record-breaking snow levels, adult chickadees showed the lowest probability of survival ever measured at our site. This exceptionally extreme winter came with recurrent storms containing cold weather and high winds, making it difficult for even the memory savvy chickadees to forage and survive.\nNevertheless, triumphant populations have persisted in high-elevation mountain environments, but their future is becoming uncertain.\n“It’s weather whiplash,” says Adrian Harpold, a mountain ecohydrologist. Harpold works to understand variations in climate patterns within forest environments, and one of his field sites lies alongside our chickadee research site.\nThe Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in western North America have been experiencing more extreme snow years and drought years, amplified by climate change. Extreme snow linked to global warming might seem counterintuitive, but it’s basic physics. Warmer air can hold more moisture – about 7% more for every degree Celsius (every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) that temperatures rise. This can result in heavier snowfall when storms strike.\nIn 2023’s record winter, over 17 feet (5 meters) of snow covered the landscape that our chickadees were using every day. In fact, these intense storms and cold temperatures not only made it difficult for birds to survive the winter but made it almost impossible for them to breed the next summer: 46% of chickadee nests at our higher elevation site failed to produce any offspring. This was likely due to the deep snow that prevented them from finding emerging insects to feed nestlings or even reaching nesting sites at all until July.\nEven in years of tremendous snowfall, chickadees can still use their finely honed spatial memories to recover food. However, severe storms can shorten their survival odds. And if they do survive the winter, their nesting sites – tree cavities – may be buried under feet of snow in the spring.\nIt doesn’t matter how smart you are if you can’t reach your nest.\nExtreme snow oscillations also affect insects that are critical for feeding chickadee chicks. Limited resources lead to smaller chickadee offspring that are less likely to survive high in the mountains.\nSnow cover is good for overwintering insects in most cases, as it provides an insulating blanket that saves them from dying during those freezing months. However, if the snow persists too long into the summer, insects can run out of energy and die before they can emerge, or emerge after chickadees really need them. Drought years also can drive insect population decline.\nExtremes at both ends of the spectrum are making it harder for chickadees to thrive, and more and more we are seeing oscillations between these extremes.\nThese compounded effects mean that in some years chickadees simply don’t successfully nest at all. This leads to a decline in chickadee populations in years with worse whiplash – drought followed by high snow on repeat – especially at high elevations. This is especially concerning, as many mountain-dwelling avian species are forecasted to move up in elevation to escape warming temperatures, which may turn out to be hazardous.\nChickadees may be portrayed as radiating tranquil beauty on holiday cards, but realistically, these loud, round ruffians are tough survivors of harsh winter environments in northern latitudes.\nOur long-term research following these chickadees provides a unique window into the relationships between winter snow, chickadee populations and the biological community around them, such as coniferous forests and insect populations.\nThese relationships illustrate that climate change is a more complicated story than just the temperature climb – and that its whiplash and cascading effects can destabilize ecosystems.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.\nRead more:\nBenjamin Sonnenberg receives funding from the National Science Foundation.",

        "text": 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory researchers and those from 12 other institutions recently released an analysis of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and storage called "Roads to Removal: Options for Carbon Dioxide Removal in the United States" (R2R).\nThe report addresses climate change by outlining methods and costs for achieving the goal of a net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) economy by 2050.\nTo reach its goal, the U.S. must remove 1 billion metric tons (or tonnes) of CO2 from the atmosphere per year by 2050, store it and reduce GHG emissions, according to an LLNL news release about the report.\nR2R finds this gigaton scale removal and storage possible by increasing the intake of CO2 by forest and agricultural lands, scaling up the conversion of biomass (organic matter) into products and geologically storable CO2 and the direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere followed by geological storage.\nIf implemented, these methods can create more than 440,000 long-term jobs by 2050 and improve air and water quality.\nThey are estimated to annually cost roughly $130 billion in 2050, about 0.5% of the nation\'s current GDP, but the cost may decrease as technology advances, according to the R2R website. Funding for implementing CO2 removal is likely to come from the government and private investors, according to Jennifer Pett-Ridge, LLNL scientist and the report\'s lead author.\nIn essence, the report\'s county-level analysis and results -- based on the methods\' feasibility, capacity, costs, energy and equity and environmental justice considerations -- are meant to inform policy-makers, the government and community stakeholders on CO2 removal options for meeting the national goal, according to the news release.\n"The report offers unique research for the opportunities and challenges specific to each region in our diverse country, prioritizing local approaches and voices from community groups in natural removal solutions," wrote Jan Mazurek, senior director of carbon dioxide removal at ClimateWorks Foundation, in a press release document.\nThe report\'s CO2 removal options can be combined in a variety of ways to remove more than the goal of 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2050, so there is flexibility in choosing carbon removal options, according to the executive summary.\nCropland-soil management and forest-based solutions are ecological methods that can be implemented immediately. Together, they can remove nearly 100 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2050.\nThese ecological methods are reversible, through events like fire and insect outbreaks, but should be maximized because they are low cost; rapidly scalable; and offer co-benefits to biodiversity, water conservation and environmental quality.\nIn practice, crop-land soil management can mean planting cover crops to promote photosynthesis and the transfer of CO2 into soil and to stave off erosion, which releases carbon from the soil, according to Pett-Ridge. Perennial plants can also be planted along field borders to increase CO2 capture and reduce the soil erosion by wind.\nAs for forest-based solutions, the west -- chosen as a case study region -- would benefit from fire-resilience forest management to reduce the risk of wildfire, thus avoiding the release of up to 16 million tonnes of CO2 between 2025 and 2050 according to the R2R website.\nTo reach net-zero, it will be necessary to invest in biomass for carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) and direct air capture with geological storage (DACS) technologies, according to the news release.\nBiCRS converts biomass to longer-lasting stores of carbon, like plastic and cement, according to the R2R website. It also captures CO2 produced from biomass processing and injects the CO2 below ground. BiCRS has the potential to remove over 800 million tonnes of CO2 per year from the atmosphere for less than $100 per tonne.\nDACS works just as its name suggests. CO2 is captured from the air and placed below ground in geological storage. DACS has the potential to remove almost 14 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere per year for less than $250 per tonne.\nOptimal BiCRS and DACS locations are both limited by geological storage and renewable energy availability, since the methods both require CO2 storage and energy input, according to the executive summary.\nBut in terms of storage locations, more than 50% of land in the U.S. is suitable for underground CO2 storage. Of that, 22% is well-suited for over 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year for up to 20 years. This kind of storage is highly durable compared to storage in forests and soils.\nPotential locations for biomass conversion are well distributed across the country, while potential locations for DACS facilities are more limited, according to the website. DACS facilities could occupy places such as segments of Montana, Wyoming, Texas, Colorado and California.\nRemoving and storing CO2 from the atmosphere through cropland-soil management, forest-based solutions, BiCRS and DACS can play a part in nationwide environmental justice.\n"An equitable approach to CDR is the only path for climate action that benefits both people and the planet while reducing our net carbon emissions to zero, and we applaud the focus on equity in this analysis," wrote Mazurek.\nAs a part of justice, job creation at places like DACS facilities would boost a workforce struggling from decarbonization, according to the executive summary.\n"In another 20, 30 years, if we meet our goals to stop using fossil fuels, those (extractive energy industry) jobs won\'t exist," Pett-Ridge said. "But those individuals have a lot of skills to return CO2 into geological storage, to be involved in these fairly complex plants where we\'re taking biomass and converting it into fuel and then trucking it or piping it some distance."\nImplementation would also "improve air and water quality and reduce the severity of some damaging impacts of greenhouse gases on our climate," according to the report\'s news release. These are especially important effects to communities that are inequitably burdened by pollution.\n"This portfolio approach to CDR is a refreshing contrast to strategies that pit projects and technologies against one another," wrote Kathy Fallon, director of land and climate at the Clean Air Task Force, in a press release. "Now it\'s up to all of us to take this important resource and create the governance and investment structures needed to rapidly scale regional carbon removal portfolios and define what CDR can be used for to ensure that it complements emissions reductions."\nR2R was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Bioenergy Technologies, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and ClimateWorks Foundation.\nIn 2024, authors of the report will host free symposiums across the U.S. to explain the report\'s discoveries with community members and leaders.\nMore information about R2R can be found at https://roads2removal.org.',

        "text": "The wife of the billionaire huge fund manager credited with leading the charge to oust Claudine Gay from Harvard University is on the defensive after a new report claims she “plagiarized” her doctoral dissertation.\nThe report comes days after Gay tendered her reluctant resignation as president of the prestigious Ivy League school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after facing relentless claims of antisemitism and, more recently, plagiarism, led in part by Bill Ackman.\nThe irony…\nBusiness Insider published its report on Thursday afternoon that “found a similar pattern of plagiarism by Ackman’s wife Neri Oxman, who became a tenured professor at MIT in 2017.”\nBusiness Insider added: “Oxman plagiarized multiple paragraphs of her 2010 doctoral dissertation, Business Insider found, including at least one passage directly lifted from other writers without citation.”\nOxman, a tenured professor at MIT, all but admitted she plagiarized. But in doing so, she both defended her actions and portrayed herself as a victim.\nSuggesting Business Insider didn’t give her enough time to review the questionable, if not completely omitted citations, Oxman wrote a lengthy mea culpa on the social media app formerly known as Twitter defending herself from what appear to be valid accusations of plagiarism.\n“I omitted quotation marks for certain work that I used,” Oxman admitted in the social media post on Thursday shortly after Business Insider’s report was published.\nOxman went on to claim that she “properly credited the original source’s author(s) with references at the end of each of the subject paragraphs, and in the detailed bibliography end pages of the dissertation.” However, she “did not place the subject language in quotation marks, which would be the proper approach for crediting the work. I regret and apologize for these errors.”\nOxman said that “because some of the original sources are not online, and Business Insider was unwilling to give me beyond 4pm to review these citations,” she could not offer full confirmation of the allegations of plagiarism.\n“When I obtain access to the original sources, I will check all of the above citations and request that MIT make any necessary corrections,” Oxman added.\nIn a New York Times op-ed written by Gay and published on Wednesday, the first Black and now-former president of Harvard University similarly admitted that “some material duplicated other scholars’ language, without proper attribution” in her published works.\n“When I learned of these errors, I promptly requested corrections from the journals in which the flagged articles were published, consistent with how I have seen similar faculty cases handled at Harvard,” Gay continued.\nSound familiar?\nOxman did not acknowledge the apparent double standard at play as she apologized for the same transgression that helped push Gay out of Harvard.\nPrior to Business Insider’s report, the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network led a team in New York City picketing outside of the office of Ackman, who’s been called a “bully” for leading calls for Gay’s ouster.\n“President Gay’s resignation is about more than a person or a single incident. This is an attack on every Black woman in this country who’s put a crack in the glass ceiling,” Sharpton said in a statement emailed to NewsOne. “It’s an assault on the health, strength, and future of diversity, equity, and inclusion – at a time when Corporate America is trying to back out of billions of dollars in commitments. Most of all, this was the result of Bill Ackman’s relentless campaign against President Gay, not because of her leadership or credentials but because he felt she was a DEI hire.”\nAckman — a Harvard alumnus who is reportedly now pushing for the resignation of MIT’s president — pounced on Gay’s congressional testimony last month when she spoke of a “deeply concerning rise in antisemitism” on Harvard’s campus following a deadly attack by Hamas against Israel in October.\n“At Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard’s rules of bullying and harassment?” Republican New York Rep. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik asked.\n“It can be, depending on the context,” Gay responded.\nThose seven noncommittal words uttered by Gay initially served as the basis for opponents of her presidency, including and especially Ackman, calling for her to be fired.\nWhen that effort failed, conservatives seeking Gay’s removal soon turned their attention to claims of plagiarism in her PhD thesis.\nThe Boston Globe reported that “Ackman distributed a form online where people could sign” a letter expressing a vote of no confidence in Gay that allegedly had the support of more than 1,000 Harvard students, alumni and affiliates.\nLess than a month later, Gay officially resigned.\nIn her letter of resignation, Gay said she was proud to have been Harvard’s president and seemed saddened by the decision.\n“It is a singular honor to be a member of this university, which has been my home and my inspiration for most of my professional career,” Gay wrote in part. “My deep sense of connection to Harvard and its people has made it all the more painful to witness the tensions and divisions that have riven our community in recent months, weakening the bonds of trust and reciprocity that should be our sources of strength and support in times of crisis.”\nGay also talked about the stress of her character being attacked, citing “racial animus” during her tenure as President.\n“Amidst all of this, it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor—two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am—and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus,” Gay added.\nFollowing the resignation, conservatives have put diversity programs back in front of the political firing squad with right-wing mouthpieces taking to social media to call Gay a diversity hire and using the moment to bash affirmative action more than six months after the Supreme Court gutted the race-conscious admissions process.\nNot surprisingly, Ackman was among them. He bashed the concept of DEI and suggested that it was a form of racism.\n“Under DEI’s ideology, any policy, program, educational system, economic system, grading system, admission policy, (and even climate change due to its disparate impact on geographies and the people that live there), etc. that leads to unequal outcomes among people of different skin colors is deemed racist,” Ackman posted. “As a result, according to DEI, capitalism is racist, Advanced Placement exams are racist, IQ tests are racist, corporations are racist, or in other words, any merit-based program, system, or organization which has or generates outcomes for different races that are at variance with the proportion these different races represent in the population at large is by definition racist under DEI’s ideology.”\nHe continued: “In order to be deemed anti-racist, one must personally take action to reverse any unequal outcomes in society. The DEI movement, which has permeated many universities, corporations, and state, local and federal governments, is designed to be the anti-racist engine to transform society from its currently structurally racist state to an anti-racist one.”\nThus far, Ackman has not called for his wife to step down from MIT for the same alleged transgression for which he accused Gay at Harvard.\nDr. Claudine Gay began working at Harvard in 2006 as a government professor and became an educator of African and African American Studies the following year.\nThe university appointed her as a Wilbur A. Cowett Professor of Government in 2015, and she served as Dean of Social Science from then until 2018.\nGay has also worked closely with Harvard’s previous president, Lawrence S. Bacow, for the past five years.\nLast year, Harvard appointed Gay to be its 30th president, making her the first Black person and just the second woman to hold the position in the school’s 387 years of existence. Gay’s resignation gave her the distinction of having the briefest presidency at Harvard.\nAccording to the Harvard Gazette, Dr. Alan Garber, Harvard’s chief academic officer, will serve as interim president.\nThis is America.\nSEE ALSO:\nOp-Ed: Does Ending Affirmative Action Help Asian Americans?\nHow DEI Programs Have Made A Difference At Colleges And Universities\n-\nHeart In Your Hands: Important Lifestyle Changes For Heart Failure Recovery\n-\nHow To Support A Loved One Who Is Living With Heart Failure\n-\nLife In Heart Failure Recovery\n-\nBlack Woman Amazon Driver Attacked By ‘Racist’ Karen On Video Is Planning Legal Action Against White Woman\n-\nA List of Karens Who Messed Around and Found Out\n-\nMainstream Media Ignoring NBA Star Josh Giddey’s Criminal Investigation Into Underage Sex Allegations\n-\nAfter Delays, Dr. Umar Johnson 'Finally' Sets An Opening Date For His School For Black Boys\n-\nThe Irony: After Claudine Gay's Ouster, Bill Ackman's Wife Admits She ‘Plagiarized’ Her MIT Dissertation",

        "text": "Historically, First Parish UCC in Gorham has promoted environmental stewardship as a natural link between its values and actions as a faith community. In addition to the focus on social justice common to faith organizations, the church has declared itself to be responsible stewards of the earth and pledged a commitment to addressing the challenges associated with climate change.\nIn 2010, the church authorized an energy audit to identify opportunities for reducing heat loss, upgrading systems, improving the comfort of the facility, and lowering costs. This proved to be a challenge in a drafty, 225-year-old building that leaked air and relied on aging heating systems. Following the audit, some systems were converted from oil to natural gas, taking advantage of the nearby gas line. This was followed by the establishment of an Environmental Justice Committee that led to upgrading recycling efforts, smart energy practices, and the creation of educational events for the congregation and the community.\nWhen minister Christine Dyke arrived in 2018, she was a robust advocate for environmental projects and supported the initiatives. In 2020, she urged the installation of 4 electric vehicle charging stations on church property with the help of a grant from Efficiency Maine. Although few members had EVs at the time, the installation reflected the values of the church.\nDyke said “As a faith community we are called upon to be responsible stewards of the earth and do what we can to curb our use of fossil fuels.”\nAfter the charging stations were operational in the summer of 2021, the congregation turned its attention to other projects. The installation of solar panels to generate electricity seemed like the next natural step to use less fossil fuel and save money on electrical costs. The newer addition to the building, a.k.a. Fellowship Hall had the perfect southern orientation for the panels while preserving the appearance of the historical building.\nA study showed that the payback period would be 14 years but factoring in a government rebate provided by congressional passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and improved efficiency of the panels, the payback period was revised downward to 8 years. The congregation voted overwhelmingly to authorize the project and money was raised to support the effort.\n“This was the easiest fundraising effort I have ever experienced” said Dyke, noting the strong commitment by the congregation.\nThe installation was completed by Revision Energy in July 2023 and became operational in October of 2023 generating an estimated 30,000-kilowatt hours of power annually to the church and the electrical grid. Simultaneously, high efficiency heat pumps were installed in some of the newer sections of the building to provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer.\nThe project is now operational and serves as a model for the community, saves money for the church and demonstrates the activism of a community committed to responsible environmental practices. As you pass the church, look up at the solar array on the roof and realize that this system is generating power from the sun to be used by the church and the community.",

        "text": "I grew up in San Rafael in the 1970s. The kids I played with at school were the children of teachers, firefighters, small business owners and plumbers who also lived in our neighborhoods. I loved my childhood in Marin – our local community was close knit, neighbors looked out for each other and most people lived and worked in the county.\nToday, we are faced with a more complex, diverse community landscape. While challenges like housing affordability, climate change, homelessness and traffic weigh heavily on our minds, I see a vibrant future for Marin. That future can be achieved by creating solutions through the lens of the community we want to be. With the right leadership, our community can flourish beyond what I cherished in my childhood.\nHere are four elements of a roadmap that will make our community stronger and address our changing environment:\nFirst, we need to pursue sensible affordable housing options, particularly for our workforce and seniors, that reflect our values here in Marin. Housing is the No. 1 priority for most residents according to a recently released Marin community survey.\nThe ability to have our teachers, caretakers, health care workers and firefighters live in our county has numerous benefits, including making it easier to recruit and retain a high quality workforce while generating more local tax revenue. An innovative model of this type of affordable workforce housing is the upcoming Oak Hill project near San Quentin, specifically designated for Marin educators and county employees.\nBy 2027, more people will be over 60 than under 30 in our county and it is essential we have inclusive housing options for seniors. The Tam Houses in San Anselmo represent one creative solution. These two lovely homes provide high quality, affordable housing for single seniors based on cooperative living, communal dinners, and all within walking distance of downtown San Anselmo.\nSecond, we need to build on our proud history of environmental stewardship in Marin. Nearly 84% of our land is protected from development, mostly as a result of the work of ordinary people coming together. We can keep Marin a beautiful, safe place to live while at the same time activating our community to address both climate change preparedness and transportation issues.\nThird, engaging our rapidly diversifying community in an authentic way has never been more critical. The number of Latino, Asian, and Black residents in Marin has nearly tripled since the census in 2020. As a community, our responsibility is to be inclusive of all our members. This can be achieved by equitable Marin County commission representation, as well as supporting organizations like the Canal Alliance and Play Marin who help hundreds of diverse Marin families every year by creating ladders to success.\nFourth, the foundation of every community is built on trust, accountability and fiscal transparency. We need to do better as a county in being responsive to all of our community members. Initiatives like Project Homekey, the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard upgrade and Flood Control Zone 9 should be opportunities to gain alignment with our larger community and allow individuals to offer feedback and come up with innovative solutions.\nAs a former president of the Kentfield School District Board of Trustees during the pandemic, I led our engagement with parents, teachers and administrators; the Kentfield School District became a model for how schools could reopen safely and quickly while consistently maintaining a balanced budget.\nCommunity engagement has never been more important in Marin. By tackling our issues as a community, we will be stronger for it.\nHeather McPhail Sridharan is a candidate for District 2 seat on the Marin County Board of Supervisors on the March ballot.

        "text": "Relief may be somewhere down the road for residents of Rosedale and others on the Rockaway Peninsula and in parts of Nassau County who use a major corridor that is prone to being submerged during heavy rainfall.\nElected officials and members of the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice and the city departments of Transportation, Parks and Emergency Management announced on Dec. 15 that the Big Apple had received $3.1 million via the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services.\nThe federal grant for the Brookville Boulevard Flood Mitigation Study, which will be supplemented with an additional $300,000 by the city, will go toward an analysis and feasibility review of the eponymous corridor from 149th Avenue to Rockaway Boulevard, colloquially known as Snake Road, a DOT spokesman told the Chronicle.\nDOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said in a statement that he is looking forward to FEMA funds being used to analyze the situation in Rosedale in order to develop plans to mitigate flooding on Snake Road.\n“Brookville Boulevard’s Snake Road section has been long plagued by flooding from high tides and coastal storms, and the situation is expected to worsen as sea levels rise further due to climate change,” Rodriguez said.\nDeputy Mayor of Operations Meera Joshi thanked the Biden administration for helping New York get ready for a changing climate, adding that shoring up Brookville will take every level of government.\n“Preparedness for rising sea levels is a macro effort, it’s also a battle fought street by street and throughway by throughway,” Joshi said in a statement.\nFor years, high tides and coastal storms have flooded the 0.8-mile stretch along Brookville Boulevard, which connects people from the Rockaways and Five Towns, Long Island, to Southeast Queens. It also extends through the tidal wetlands of Idlewild and Hook Creek Parks.\nThe goal of the $3.4 million study is to improve traffic safety and the ecological health of the surrounding area. It will involve public engagement meetings (with community boards, elected officials, civics, sister agencies and state partners), traffic data collection, extensive topographical analysis and environmental mitigation, while also taking into account the utility locations and regulatory constraints that come with environmental and wetland mitigation.\nIn the short term, the DOT has strategically erected signs and placed warning devices along the corridor to improve conditions ahead of any potential capital improvements. In the long term, the agency wants to either raise the existing roadway to various elevations or reroute it to create a shorter and more direct route between 149th Avenue and Rockaway Boulevard once the analysis is complete. The study is expected to start sometime this year and will last for 30 months, according to a DOT spokeswoman.\nMarcia O’Brien, Rosedale Civic Association’s third vice president, said she is excited to see some movement being made toward improving Snake Road and hopes that the agencies involved make a real effort in communicating with the public about the project.\nO’Brien moved to the area in 1999 when Helen Marshall was the borough president.\n“I am happy to see that all of the key agencies are in one accord. I look forward to receiving ongoing updates on this study,” said O’Brien, who wants to get quarterly reports on the analysis. “It would be great to also have town hall meetings with the community.”",

        "text": "Here are the top stories from our data visuals team in 2023\nThe Texas Tribune’s data visuals team helped contextualize many of the state’s major stories this year. Here’s a look at some of our most memorable work.\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe Tribune’s data visuals team was responsible for a wide range of creative and innovative work this year. Our data journalists looked at the long-term impacts of climate change in Texas, helped readers understand the Ken Paxton impeachment trial and much more. Here’s our year in review.\nLike the rest of the newsroom, the data visuals team was absorbed in covering the 2023 legislative session, including charting the lack of diversity in the legislature and putting Texas’ enormous budget surplus into context. As the end of the regular session drew near, we helped track the status of major bills and key deadlines. And when lawmakers returned to debate school vouchers, we helped readers understand how vouchers work, examined the geographical disparities in private schools locations and looked at underperforming charter networks that were allowed by the state to expand.\nOn the political front, we covered the Paxton impeachment saga, with designer/developer Alex Ford creating a quick-turn diagram showing how the impeachment process would unfold. Before Paxton’s Senate trial in September, senior developer Carla Astudillo dug deep into his campaign finance records to see who backs him and later examined one of those PACs more closely when ties to a known white supremacist were revealed. Designer/developer Yuriko Schumacher published two visually impressive and informative stories setting the scene for how Paxton’s impeachment trial was going to work. Finally, when Paxton was acquitted, we tracked how Senators voted.\nWe also worked on major stories outside of politics, including a deep, long-term look at climate change’s impact on Texas. This story, which was a culmination of months of research and design, showed how the state has gotten hotter over the last 100-plus years. We also examined how this past summer was the second hottest on record and helped visualize renewable energy trends in the state.\nOur team was involved in several other critical stories this year. Caroline Covington, the Tribune's Scripps Howard data visualization fellow, dug into a large amount of unreported air monitoring data to show large spikes in benzene levels after a 2019 chemical fire outside of Houston. Covington also wrote about how a frayed refugee system is creating obstacles for Afghans in Texas. Dan Keemahill, data reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative team, helped show how a dark money nonprofit was trying to work to defeat a Midland school bond. Astudillo put together diagrams on the power and influence of the Texas attorney general office and later wrote about the lack of hate crimes being reported in Texas. And summer fellow Susie Webb visualized and helped write two stories on the growing number of gun fatalities among young people in Texas.\nThis year, we also found time to cover declining animal populations in the state. Webb wrote a feature story on bats in central Texas, whose numbers are ravaged by a new deadly disease. And Schumacher charted the drop in oyster harvest areas along the Gulf Coast.\nTexans need truth. Help us report it.\nIndependent Texas reporting needs your support. The Texas Tribune delivers fact-based journalism for Texans, by Texans — and our community of members, the readers who donate, make our work possible.

        "text": "- President Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) significantly scaled up its enforcement and grantmaking activities related to environmental justice in 2023.\n- The EPA’s 2023 enforcement statistics show that the agency increased its inspections in areas of potential environmental justice concern and that the dollar amount of judicial and administrative penalties assessed in such areas also reached recent highs.\n- “EPA-funded researchers dredge reams of data to find a few trivial environmental differences between rich and poor communities and then blame the inconsequential differences on racism,” Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow for the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute and a member of the Trump EPA transition team, told the DCNF.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intensified its “environmental justice” agenda in 2023 in terms of enforcement and grantmaking.\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan said in May 2023 that the agency has “built environmental justice into [its] very DNA,” and over the course of the year the agency significantly increased enforcement in specific areas across the country, while handing out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to environmentalist groups to pursue environmental justice projects. These developments reflect a broader effort by the EPA and Biden administration to infuse social justice ideology into bureaucratic functions, and a strategy to build political patronage by funding activist organizations with taxpayer dollars, experts told the DCNF.\n“From day one, President Biden and EPA have been committed to delivering progress on environmental justice and civil rights, and ensuring that underserved and overburdened communities are at the forefront of our work,” an EPA spokeswoman told the DCNF. “The agency is ensuring that people who’ve struggled to have their concerns addressed see action to solve the problems they’ve been facing for generations. These efforts to integrate EJ and equity into all of EPA’s work is seen through the work of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance in its enforcement of environmental laws.” (RELATED: Shortlist For EPA’s Multi-Billion Dollar ‘Green’ Fund Features Groups With Deep Connections To Biden Admin, Dems)\nIn fiscal year 2023, more than 60% of federal inspections occurred in areas of potential environmental justice concern, reflecting a significant increase in both the total number and relative proportion of civil enforcement case conclusions in such areas compared to years past, the EPA enforcement data shows.\nThe estimated amount of pollution — measured in pounds — reduced, treated or eliminated by the EPA in potential environmental justice concern areas was lower in fiscal year 2023 than in fiscal year 2021, according to the EPA enforcement data. The 41.18 million pounds that the EPA estimates it handled in such areas amounts to less than one-third of the 137.84 million pounds that the Trump EPA recorded in fiscal year 2019.\nWhile the amount of pollution that the EPA estimates it reduced, treated or eliminated was not exceptionally high, the agency’s actions resulted in an estimated $69.15 million worth of administrative and judicial penalties assessed in areas of environmental justice concern in fiscal year 2023, a number that is far greater than any figure recorded since fiscal year 2014, according to the enforcement statistics.\nThe EPA asserts that environmental justice can only be achieved when “everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards, and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn and work.”\nThe Biden administration “wants to say that pollution is racist, in the same way that they want to say education is racist,” Mandy Gunasekara, who served as EPA chief of staff during the Trump administration, told the DCNF. “They are using this as a political tool that is not supported by legal precedent … The problem with this administration is that they lack a balance in their mission; they just want to grab headlines, and to grab headlines you need extremes, and one of the easiest ways to do that is via environmental justice, as we have seen. It’s the ultimate weaponization of industrial action.”\nThe EPA’s environmental justice agenda is part of a broader push by the White House, which sees the concept as key to “confronting longstanding environmental injustices” endured primarily by “marginalized, underserved and overburdened communities.”\n“EPA-funded researchers dredge reams of data to find a few trivial environmental differences between rich and poor communities and then blame the inconsequential differences on racism,” Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow for the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute and a member of the Trump EPA transition team, told the DCNF. “If minority communities suffer from anything, it’s poverty. Ironically, poverty is caused by EJ policies that ban manufacturing facilities and kill good-paying industry jobs.” (RELATED: EPA Bureaucrats Can Rake In Six-Figure Salaries While Mostly Working From Home, Report Finds)\nIn addition to the enforcement aspect of EPA’s work on environmental justice, the agency has massive amounts of taxpayer dollars at its disposal to give to activist organizations that engage in their own environmental justice initiatives.\nIn December 2023, the EPA named the recipients of a combined $600 million in grants for environmental justice pursuits. Among the awardees were explicitly left-wing activist groups and incubators such as the Climate Justice Alliance and The Minneapolis Foundation, as well as Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, which facilitates de facto get-out-the-vote efforts.\nThe money came from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill.\nIn April 2023, the agency shelled out a combined $177 million to a range of environmental groups to serve as “Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers.” Some of those recipients, such as WE ACT for Environmental Justice and the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, had previously supported the Biden administration’s climate agenda.\nUnder Biden, the agency’s environmental justice grantmaking has essentially served as a “political tool” that is “used to fund activism of the left,” Gunasekara told the DCNF. “That’s what this administration is using environmental justice for, and it is really unfortunate because it degrades the way that environmental justice is considered in the administration … The communities that really need EPA’s help, they don’t need more activists.”\nIn addition to the more than $700 million in environmental justice grants that the agency distributed in 2023, the EPA is also gearing up to hand out approximately $2 billion in so-called “community change grants.” The program, also endowed by the IRA, is “designed to deliver on the transformative potential of the IRA for communities most adversely and disproportionately impacted by climate change, legacy pollution and historical disinvestments,” according to the agency’s website.\n“During 2024, environmental justice will be a means for the Biden administration to funnel money to poor communities for election purposes,” Milloy told the DCNF.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "David Woods recently strolled into Cartel Roasting Co. to discuss his new meadery, Brillé Mead Co.\nOver a cappuccino, he said starting a business and his hopes for his fledgling meadery, which will open to the public in January.\nBrillé is inside the former Dillinger Brewing Co. on North Oracle Road. It is one of only a handful of meaderies in Arizona, and it will share a space with Mosaic Brewing Co.\nWoods, 27, described Brillé on his website, noting his vision “is firmly rooted in my experiences growing up in an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Adopted by a loving American family in 2009, I’ve spent over a decade away from my place of origin. Yet, with each passing year, my connection to my heritage deepens and widens.”\nWhile living in Arizona, Woods started making Ethiopian mead, called T’ej, at home. Woods uses hops in his mead, along with Arizona honey, spices, fruit and Ethiopian-origin coffee beans. He ferments his meads in stainless steel tanks for three months.\nHe said that the meadery’s name, “Brillé,” is derived from the Ethiopian drinking vessel called “Berelé,” the round drinking flask customarily used to serve T’ej.\n“I wanted to make something from home,” said Woods, who also is an engineer at Raytheon. “Why not use the platform to share a little bit about my culture?”\nHis 750-milliliter bottles – the same size as a standard bottle of red or white wine – will retail between $25 and $30. Woods also will sell other flavors of mead by the glass and bottle.\nMead, which originated 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, has been referenced in ancient Greek history as a gift from Aphrodite, earning its nickname as the “nectar of the gods.”\nMead doesn’t actually fit into the categories of wine, beer or liquor. It is made by using a traditional fermentation process – but instead of grains or grapes, honey is used.\n“It’s an alternative to beer and wine, and depending on the day, it can be better than either,” Woods said.\nNot all mead is sweet, however. The flavor depends on the type of honey used, other ingredients and fermentation time. Mead can range from sweet to dry, and still to sparkling. The longer the fermentation time, the drier the mead and the higher the alcohol content.\nWoods described his mead as having “a lot of flavor with a hint of sweetness.” He’ll offer varieties that range from dry to semi-sweet.\nAbout a year ago, Shanna Nelson was working at Dillinger as an assistant brewer when she met Woods. Nelson now works at Borderlands Brewing Co. and considers Woods a friend.\nThe 26-year-old describes the taste of Woods’ mead as “earthy and herbal, and sweet but not too sweet,” and sometimes likes to mix it with seltzer.\n“I think it’s an exceptional product,” Nelson said. “Most mead is one note, and that note is very sweet. I really appreciate that it’s more complex than a traditional mead in an American sense. I think it’s so interesting.”\nSome studies assert that mead contains health benefits because it contains honey.\nIt’s true that honey boasts anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant benefits. In addition, the fruits, herbs and spices that are sometimes infused into mead can have health perks.\nAlcohol causes inflammation, however, and mead’s 4% to 20% alcohol by volume might cancel some of the touted benefits.\nMead also can have a positive impact on the environment, because mead encourages the preservation of bees. Climate change, deforestation and chemical-heavy agricultural practices are killing off scads of bees, so every little bit helps.\nOf course, starting a business by yourself is no easy task. Woods is quick to note that he had help getting started.\n“It’s a matter of leveraging what’s around us,” he said. “I’ve gotten a lot of support.”\nAbout a year ago, Woods was able to leverage space to brew his mead and serve customers at Dillinger Brewing Co. Eric Sipe, Dillinger’s owner at the time, had met Woods through someone at the UA Arizona. When Woods proposed sharing the brewery’s space – and shared some of his mead – Sipe jumped at the idea.\n“I instantly said, ‘Yes,’ with no hesitation,” said Sipe, who opened Dillinger seven years ago. “I allowed him to use as much of my space as possible.”\nLast year, Sipe sold Dillinger to the owners of Serial Grillers, who have renamed the North Oracle Road brewery Mosaic Brewing Co. The Serial Grillers Restaurant Group also owns Transplant Pizza and Craft, A Modern Drinkery.\n“He’s got all the right ideas, the product is great,” Sipe said. “He’s got the traditional Ethiopian style, which might be the sweetest. He’s really doing a good job of making Southwestern flavors.\n“Plus, he’s a super, super likable guy.”\nSipe is confident that Brillé will be a success.\n“He was literally growing up in an Ethiopian orphanage until he was 12,” Sipe said. “This is probably the easiest thing he has done in his life.\n“As long as he wants to do it, he will be successful.”\nBrillé Mead Co.\n3895 N. Oracle Road, Tucson\n520-449-6862, www.brillemead.com",

She shouldn’t be stopping our vote for Trump.\nCatherine Rampell\nI’d love for columnist Catherine Rampell to enter the real world one day. She’s so noble in wanting to eliminate fossil fuels but has absolutely no clue on how dependent her life is upon them, starting with the food she eats. She probably has food that was planted and harvested by equipment that was made and fueled by fossil fuels. … It was probably packaged in plastic that is made from fossil fuels. She paid with her plastic credit card, or maybe her phone. But the fossil fuels were used to make the plastic and her phone. … If she wants to virtue signal that this is something that’s really important to her, she can restructure her life and grow her own food and eliminate all the electronics and transportation that makes her life so pleasant.\nSend immigrants here\nI think it’s high time that Mayor Johnson of Denver and the governor of Texas, Abbott, start sending immigrant buses directly to Larimer County. Denver’s kind of getting full. Larimer County has turned so blue. They chatter about it and talk about it on the social media. Loveland could lead the way. They have two council humans that support equity, diversity and inclusion. They could probably take on a thousand immigrants.

        "text": "Gov. Phil Scott delivered his annual State of the State address on Thursday, Jan. 4. The following transcript was provided by the governor’s office.\nMr. President, Madam Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly, and fellow Vermonters:\nIn his second Inaugural Address, Governor Weeks talked about recovering from the Flood of 1927. He said, “The common watchwords” were “progress and rehabilitation,” noting the true spirit of Vermont is its “indomitable courage in a time of adversity.” And that “the faith and valor of Vermonters has turned catastrophe into opportunity.”\nProgress and rehabilitation. Catastrophe into opportunity.\nFrom the first struggles of the pandemic to the rising waters of July and December, and a once in a century opportunity to revitalize our communities – the indomitable courage of Vermonters is as strong as ever.\nThis session, let’s honor their resilience and strength, kindness and generosity – not only in flood recovery, but by working together to address persistent problems, like demographics, housing, affordability, and recent increases in violence and crime.\nTo meet this moment, we are going to have to prioritize, set aside good things that are less urgent, and rise above the toxic polarization of America’s political parties to focus our work directly on these fundamental issues.\nIf we do, we’ll turn catastrophe into opportunity once more.\n***\nPresident Clinton’s advisor James Carville famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid.”\nNow, I’m not calling anyone stupid, but I think you’ll get my point that in Vermont, we could insert “demographics” in place of “economy.”\nI get asked all the time, even by some of you, “where did all the workers go?”\nSo let me share three numbers from your Joint Fiscal Office that tell you everything you need to know: 14,000, 28,000 and 48,000. As of 2022, we have 14,000 fewer kids under the age of 18 than we did in 2010. During that same period, we have 28,000 fewer adults ages 40 to 54, which is the core of our workforce. And we have 48,000 more over the age of 65. This is all within just 12 years, but this is nothing new. It’s been happening for decades.\nLet that sink in for a moment.\nAs the JFO points out, this can mean higher per pupil costs, declines in income and sales tax revenue, and increased demand for services like healthcare.\nThey conclude, if nothing changes, and I quote, “Vermont’s ratio of older residents to working-aged people will continue to rise, placing a greater burden on workers to support both young and old.”\nIf this sounds familiar, it’s because you heard it from me in 2017, when I said, “The biggest obstacle we face to economic sustainability, is a shrinking workforce.” In 2018, I said demographic trends are, “shifting the tax burden onto fewer and fewer people.” Again in 2020, I said, “Our demographic crisis is, without question, the greatest challenge we face as a state.”\nUnfortunately, it hasn’t gotten any better. It continues to be an issue we must solve to meet today’s obligations, and make every investment needed for the future.\nAnd to have any chance of reversing our demographic trends, there are three issues we can’t ignore: public safety, affordability, and housing.\nThese challenges are urgent, immediate, and we must address them this session.\n***\nFor as long as I can remember, our safe, close-knit communities, and the peace of mind healthy cities and towns provide, have been integral to keeping and attracting families to our state.\nBut with crime rising in too many places, I fear many see the Vermont they know, slipping away.\nA growing number of headlines share news of the latest murder, drug-related shooting, and small businesses struggling with increasing vandalism and theft.\nHere’s the thing, it’s not just the headlines. According to reports from the Council of State Governments, in 2017 Vermont had the second lowest property crime and second lowest violent crime rates in the nation. By 2022, we had dropped to 18th and eighth.\nAnd in the last 10 years, violent crime reported to police increased 56%, aggravated assault by 65%, sexual assault by 76%, and homicide by 166%. We cannot deny these trends.\nWhen those who victimize others are put back on the streets, hours after being apprehended only to reoffend again and again, Vermonters question law enforcement, prosecutors, our courts, and they question the wisdom of the work done here in this building.\nNow, I want to give credit where credit is due: We’ve made progress on justice reform and treating addiction as the public health crisis it is.\nBut when spiking crime rates make it clear that not all the changes have been effective, we have a responsibility to take a step back and consider other strategies.\nWe must make a real effort this session to solidify our place as the safest state in the country and reverse the increases we’re seeing – both for the people we serve and the victims of these crimes.\n***\nWe must also acknowledge our crisis of affordability is making it difficult to address public safety, as well as other areas like education and healthcare. And the high cost of everyday life in Vermont is dulling the tools we’ve put in place to keep and attract working families.\nIn three weeks, I’ll present my budget for Fiscal Year 2025, and it will be a much different picture than previous years. “Sobering” comes to mind.\nWith historic one-time federal aid ending, another large increase in our pension obligation, and last year’s spending decisions catching up to us, we are back to where we were several years ago with difficult decisions to be made.\nFor many of you, this will be the first time you’ll work on a budget without hundreds of millions of dollars in surplus. For others, it’s déjà vu.\nOnce again, we’ll face the discomfort of saying “no,” choosing between many good things, and maintaining the discipline to focus on what Vermonters need most.\nI continue to believe we need to keep our spending within existing revenue. So in full transparency, you can expect my budget will increase by about 3%.\nI know from experience, many of you view 3% growth as an “austerity” approach.\nSo it’s important to know that with this increase, and after meeting our obligations, we have very little money left. So, if you go higher, we will be spending more than we’re taking in, leading to higher taxes and fees, adding to the burden Vermonters are already feeling.\nI’m sure you’re aware the federal government just announced its increase for those on social security, which was 3.2%. So if our seniors are expected to manage to that, it seems as though we should do the same.\nNow, I’m a realist, and I know you have a super majority. You’ve proven the final budget, and the growing burden of taxes, fees and other policy-driven costs, is in your hands.\nSo all I can do is make my case, which is the same case I’ve made to Vermonters since I first ran for governor. What I hear from people every day is they can’t afford to pay more, or even what they are paying now.\nSo this year, let’s do what’s best for them, and live within their means.\n***\nUnfortunately, the cost of our Pre-K through 12 education system has already grown beyond the means of many.\nAs you know, it’s about to grow even more. Because if nothing changes, we’ll see an estimated 18.5% increase in statewide property tax bills. And that’s after we use a $37 million Education Fund surplus to buy rates down.\nIn total, this would be a quarter billion-dollar tax increase on Vermonters. For a family with a $250,000 home, their bill could go up by $650 a year. And with a $400,000 home, you could pay an additional $1,000.\nBefore you brush this off because of income sensitivity, remember the vast majority will still see an increase. And renters don’t typically pay property taxes directly, but if a landlord receives a $1,000 increase on their four-unit building, I’m pretty sure it’ll be passed on to those who live there.\nSo think about those folks who are just barely getting by – living paycheck to paycheck, already deciding what bills to pay and what to do without. Or the working parents, who need every extra penny so their kids can go to summer camp. Or the small business owner rebuilding after the flood, working hard just to stay open.\nThey’re all going to struggle to figure out how to pay for this. Not to mention inflation that’s still making everything more expensive. Or future burdens like the payroll tax you passed last year, that will take effect in July. Or the 20% increase in DMV fees that began three days ago – both over my, and some of your, objections (just not enough of you). Concern about taxes, fees and increased costs is a concern about people.\nI appreciate the optimism I’ve heard from some of you, who think we can just buy it down. Some even committed to getting it down to 2%, or lower. So to be clear, that would cost $225 million.\nAnd from the average person’s perspective, it doesn’t matter which pocket the money comes from, whether it’s the property tax, income tax, or some other creative combination – it’s still going to hurt.\nKeep in mind, the Education Fund is now more than $2.1 billion dollars. With fewer than 83,000 Pre-K through 12 students, we’re spending about $25,000 a year per student, among the very highest in the country. And that might be okay with me if we were leading in student performance. But in several areas, we’re in the middle of the pack, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\nPlease know, this is not a critique of our teachers or our students. It’s the result of an education infrastructure that is too large for the number it serves, so not enough money is making it to the kids.\nUnfortunately, there’s no quick fix to this. But we could discuss ideas I’ve put on the table before, like additional consolidation or classroom size targets, addressing healthcare and retirement costs, moving to a statewide teacher contract, or capping property tax growth. And I’m sure you have ideas on how to contain spending as well.\nI believe we all want better education outcomes for our kids, and to have a system our seniors, families and young workers can afford. So let’s work together to address the affordability issues we can control and restore the size of the working class so there are more people to pay taxes, and more kids in our schools.\n***\nTo do that, we need to jumpstart housing in the areas that need it most.\nBecause this crisis is not only holding us back when it comes to filling jobs and refilling our schools – it’s hurting Vermonters here right now. Due to a lack of housing, and our tax and regulatory policies, rents and purchase prices are far too high, and rising.\nDecades of studies and data show it’s too expensive, too complicated and too slow to buy, rehab and build in Vermont.\nSince March of 2020, we’ve invested over $500 million to fix vacant units, construct new homes and expand shelter capacity. This is unprecedented. And it’s on top of the $37 million dollar housing bond we passed in 2017, which at the time was the biggest investment we’d ever made.\nWe have made progress, and it far exceeds what we were doing 10 years ago. But $500 million is a lot of money, so we need to be honest about what we’re getting, why it costs so much, and how to lower it.\nOverall, we’re seeing about 2,200 residential units permitted each year. About one-third of these, around 700, are state funded. Census data and vacancy rates show that to meet current demand and create a healthy market that puts downward pressure on prices, we need 6,800 units right now. Most of our funding goes to homes that cost, on average, $450,000 per unit to develop. $450,000! So that’s $3 billion in public and private funding, just to fill the gap we have today.\nWith these costs in mind, I think most of us would agree, something’s got to change. ***\nLast year I said, “we won’t be able to make the most of this opportunity if we don’t address the decades-old regulations holding us back.” While we took some steps, I know many of you would agree, we need to do a lot more.\nThe fact is, Act 250 did exactly what it was intended to do. It slowed down growth, and in some cases, stopped it altogether. But it was enacted at a time when we were growing way too fast. Today we face a different reality – one where families desperately need homes, and communities need reinvestment.\nThere’s an expression: “If nothing changes, then nothing will really change.” In our case, that means if nothing changes, things will continue to get worse.\nWe’ve committed the funds, and laid the groundwork, but if we don’t truly address Act 250, we won’t solve our housing crisis.\nEvery single one of you, and the people you represent, need a voice in this debate. This issue is too important and too consequential for two committees, and a couple of special interest groups, to control the outcome.\nIf we make commonsense improvements, we can give young families the decent, affordable homes they need. We can offer seniors a chance to enjoy retirement, without the burden of a large home they can’t afford. And we can put homeless Vermonters in real homes, not over-priced hotel rooms we can’t afford.\nBy jumpstarting housing for working families, we can revitalize communities, refill our schools, and make our neighborhoods more inviting in all 14 counties. We can help solve the challenges we face – funding healthcare and education, climate change mitigation, I.T. infrastructure, and so much more.\nHousing is key, and it’s something we can do right now. So let’s work together and get more families in homes faster, and at a cost they can afford.\n***\nMy friends, I’ve now spent about 20 minutes talking about the significant challenges we face. There’s no doubt, we have a lot of hard work ahead.\nBut there’s also a lot of good things happening.\nLike the opening of Beta Technologies’ new production facility, leading the revolution in electric aviation, adding to our green economy. The opportunity we have with the federal CHIPS Act to build an innovative Tech Hub and expand semiconductor manufacturing. The work of our refugee resettlement office, which along with many partners, has helped 500 refugees get settled, contributing to our communities, workforce and economy, while pursuing the American dream.\nOr how about the ten Vermont businesses that ranked among the nation’s fastest growing companies. And Killington broke ground on an infrastructure project that will boost the economy throughout the region.\nWe should also be proud of our work together to help anchor employers, like Chroma in Bellows Falls and Ethan Allen in the Northeast Kingdom, and hundreds of small businesses with flood recovery so they could reopen, stay open, grow and thrive. And this weekend, the 93-mile Lamoille Valley Rail Trail will be fully open, after crews worked quickly to repair the damage caused by the July storms.\nThese are just some of the many reasons I’m still incredibly optimistic about our future. ***\nAnother reason is because I see a path where we can reverse our downward trends if we prioritize these urgent crises.\nThat’s why we’ve already shared many of our proposals in these three areas.\nNow, I know these aren’t the only challenges we face, and there are many others, like addiction, healthcare costs, and climate change mitigation, where we need to – and will – continue our work.\nBut public safety, affordability, and housing are the issues that demand our immediate attention, because Vermonters are seeing, feeling, and living them every single day. And they’re critical to reversing our demographic trends.\nSo, while the lobbyists and advocates will have their agendas, and being an election year, political parties and partisans will have theirs as well, we owe it to Vermonters to put all that aside and make real progress on public safety, affordability, and housing needs – because these issues don’t discriminate based on your party affiliation.\n***\nWe’ve already laid the foundation – literally in many cases – to help revitalize communities across the state. With $1 billion from ARPA, we’ve invested in over 500 initiatives in 160 towns and cities in all 14 counties. From big capital projects to small renovations, what they all have in common is an investment in the basic tools a community needs to keep from falling behind and spark momentum for more good work.\nSo following through on each of our federally funded investments, including what we’ve allocated for state match, is one of the most important actions we can take this session.\nWe are also aligning this work with flood recovery, and the new federal dollars that come with it, to help more places restore their vitality and expand economic security.\nCatastrophe into opportunity.\n***\nImagine what neighborhoods in our communities could look like with the old, run-down houses renovated; front yards decorated for the holidays; a swing set and a sandbox in the backyard.\nThe neighborhood buzzing with the chatter of kids out sliding (or “sledding,” for those of you who are confused). Imagine seeing those empty classrooms filled with children again.\nYounger families shopping in town, getting their car, lawnmower, bike, or chainsaw serviced at their local shop, and then those small businesses going on to support their community by sponsoring local events and youth programs.\nMore workers to lessen the burden of property taxes and healthcare costs.\nGood jobs and opportunity – a hopefulness that defeats despair, and helps reduce addiction and the crime it causes.\nWe can get there, but we must follow through on what we started. We have to learn the lessons of the last few years, refocus on what’s working, and be honest about what’s not. If we do, we will turn the tide and lift all communities in every corner of our state.\n***\nMost importantly, I’m optimistic about our future because of the people of Vermont.\nOn the morning of July 11, a flood-damaged grocery store in Windsor County was filled with neighbors mucking out. And they didn’t stop there. With rows of undamaged produce and perishables, locals acted quickly to distribute it to those in need. Donating coolers and time, they helped hundreds of their neighbors by delivering food to a senior center, mobile home park, the local food shelf, and more. Even when they had to jump on an ATV to get over downed trees and washed-out roads.\nA few days later in Barre, Bob Nelson opened his hardware store, still without power and surrounded by damaged shelves and destroyed inventory. He wanted his neighbors to have what they needed to clean up their homes and businesses.\n30 miles away in Caledonia County, eight- and 10-year-old Andee and Allie Ackerman started their own business, a lemonade stand, giving every single penny of the $700 they made to help the Hardwick House of Pizza.\nWeeks later in Johnson, at Highland Heights Mobile Home Park where several residents lost everything, you could see a community who rallied to support one another. From those who spent weeks trying to find help for a long-time neighbor in crisis, to park owners Ken and Martha Harvey who moved damaged homes, cleaned up lots, and filled out FEMA paperwork. They could tell you where every single homeowner was and kept tabs on them to help if needed.\nThis is “Vermont Strong.”\nIt’s the incredible resilience found in our sense of community. It’s the “faith and valor” Governor Weeks described.\n***\nAnd it’s not just during floods.\nIn St. Albans, Shawn Careau wanted to offer a helping hand. So as the owner of a downtown restaurant, he began taping receipts for free meals on his front window for folks to claim – as he put it, with no questions asked. Patrons at the restaurant saw this and started chipping in, adding more meals to the window. Warm food on a cold day, dinner out for those who otherwise might not be able to afford it, that’s what community looks like. No one asked Shawn to do this, he saw a way to use his skills to help his neighbors and he and his customers stepped up.\nSo did families in Coventry. After learning the school playground wasn’t safe, they didn’t sit back and wait for someone else to fix the problem. They worked to provide a few swings and other basics, and then rallied support to help finish the job. With everyone pulling in the same direction, in a matter of weeks, they had rebuilt better than before.\nSometimes, it’s the little things that make the biggest difference.\nA few years ago, the residents of Wallingford were looking for a way to strengthen their town. Many of us might think that means new sidewalks or a business expanding. But in Wallingford, they kept coming back to the simple idea of just getting together. So, they brought back “Wallingford Day.” A day to celebrate who they are, reconnect with neighbors with food trucks and fireworks, art shows and auctions, music and dancing. Most importantly, it’s a day set aside to be together, a reminder that it takes effort to build community.\nFolks in Guilford also wanted to reconnect and decided to refresh an old idea. After the Civil War, grange halls became an important part of civic life in agricultural areas across the country. A place to get together, hear candidates speak, and work to solve the issues of the day. As small farms and membership dwindled, underused grange halls could be found all over the U.S. So in Guilford, they worked to bring this historic community space back to life. These days, you can see their renovated grange hall bustling with students, full of people for Thanksgiving dinner, the Apple Pie social, or raising money for a neighbor in need.\nAt a time when so much of our interaction is by text, email, social media, or Zoom, just being in the same place, at the same time, and seeing people face to face can help make the world a better place for all of us.\nFolks in East Calais knew this about their General Store. For over a century, it was a local gathering spot – somewhere to get a coffee or sandwich, catch up with your neighbors, get your news and maybe a little gossip as well. So when they were about to lose it, residents formed a Trust to purchase the building and keep this local hub alive. Nearly five years later, through pandemic and floods, the East Calais General Store reopened its doors in October.\nMany of these projects have benefited from government funding, and that’s an important role we can play. But the reality is, no grant or earmark would bring these initiatives to life on their own. Neither government, nor money, build community. People do.\nMany of those I just mentioned are here today. If they could please rise, if able, so we can thank them. And I know, there are thousands of others like them across our state, who step up for their community, each and every day. By the way, if you want the Ackerman sisters’ lemonade, or to meet some of these folks, stop by the office afterwards.\n***\nPresident Biden has said, “good communities are built by thousands of small acts of decency…”\nTo me, it’s our decency to one another, where we as Americans and Vermonters find our greatest strength.\nI’ve seen this my entire life. I saw it in my dad and in my mom, and in the people of my hometown when he passed away. I’ve seen it in teachers and classmates, co-workers, friends, neighbors, colleagues in the legislature and dedicated state employees. Like many of you, I’ve tried to pass it on to my kids.\nPresident Coolidge said Vermonters are, “pioneers who almost beggared themselves to serve others…” That’s the Vermont I know. Those are the people I know.\nBasic human decency, giving a helping hand to others around us, even to those we don’t agree with, or even like that much. This is the foundation, the bedrock of our communities.\n***\nBut traditions and values must be exercised and nurtured to be passed along to the next generation.\nDick DeGray woke up before dawn for a decade to water the 200 flowerpots that brightened up downtown Brattleboro. No one asked him to do it, and because he started at 3:00 in the morning, not many knew he did and took this good deed for granted. Now in his seventies, he’s looking to hang up his watering can.\nSo, the question is, who’s going to water the flowers?\nAcross the state from Alburgh to Vernon, Island Pond to Bennington, and everywhere in-between, there are things, large and small, that build community and give these places character and identity.\nSo, I want to talk directly to Vermonters, what is it for you? Is it the flowers or lights during the holidays? The senior center or playground? Youth sports or the local theater? Food pantries or meals on wheels? The good work done by the Rotary, Elks, Moose or Lions club, VFW and American legion?\nWhatever it is, if it matters to you, it’s time to step up, get involved, and make sure it remains for years to come.\nTake Brenda Greika, a 35-year state employee, now retired. Tomorrow is her 70th birthday, but she’s not asking for it to be about her. She’s planned a full day of shopping, eating and entertainment in downtown Montpelier.\nAll she wants is for people to support these local businesses who were devastated by the flood. And by the way, you’re all invited. Remember, no gifts, just bring your credit card!\nIt’s clear there are many people doing this good work. But they can’t do it on their own. It takes all of us.\nSo, it’s up to you to find something. Plant a tree, mentor a kid, coach a team, volunteer for your local fire department or rescue squad. Or sign up for the National Guard, which has been essential to our state emergencies and national security. We desperately need them, and they need more of you.\nBecause the reality is, that thing, that tradition, or cause, or service that means something to you, won’t last if no one carries it on.\nIt’s about action, not apathy. Dedication, not destiny.\nThe progress we’ve made in the short 246 years since our nation’s founding is not a coincidence of history. The burden of citizenship, and all who aspire to it, is the work to fulfill the promise of a more perfect union. This is the great gamble of our republic – that everyday Americans, and everyday Vermonters, will show up, do the work, and carry out those “small acts of decency” that build community.\nThat’s the most important work of all. It’s the antidote, the cure, to the hate and poison of partisanship – red versus blue; you versus me; us versus them; and the constant conflict we see on social media or cable news.\nStrengthening our communities, connecting with our neighbors, doing our part, however big or small, is how we prove there is a better way.\n***\nAs I’ve shared today, many people in our communities are setting the example for us, their elected officials.\nThe Harvey’s didn’t care whether residents were Republicans or Democrats when they helped them get back on their feet. Up in St. Albans, Shawn isn’t asking what policies you support before you get your meal. It doesn’t matter who you voted for when using the community center in Guilford, or to enjoy Wallingford Day.\nSo let’s choose to follow their example, reject partisanship, and do what’s best for the people we’re here to serve. Show up and do the work, so we don’t lose what makes Vermont so special.\nFocus on the things that strengthen our communities, so all parts of our state can build upon their character and fulfill their potential.\nAnd together, all of us in this room and across the state will meet this moment, and all that comes next.",

        "text": "The initial First Friday of a new year often reflects new directions and, in these parts, going west during Stock Show season.

The CVA gets a head start on the citywide spring print showcase with a show built on the historical base of printmaking as a tool for activism. Curated by the CVA’s Melanie Finlayson, Pressing for Change addresses issues of climate change, ecology and immigration through print artworks by nine local and national artists. Three separate artist talks are scheduled in February for further insights, and in the student-run 965 Project Gallery, a site-specific installation by local print activist Rick Griffith, Two Ways, echoes the main gallery’s politicized theme.\nFirst Friday: Manifesting and Predicting 2024\nMuseo de las Americas, 861 Santa Fe Drive\nFriday, January 5, 5 to 9 p.m.\nThe Museo makes use of the first First Friday in 2024 to allow patrons to mine the art of making predictions in the new year.

Curated by Rob and Tammy Yancey, the show includes examples of Mr. Lucero’s Metarealism and Neo-Precolumbian paintings, both styles of his own invention and powered by inner spiritualism. Consider it an opportunity: Ms. Lucero says this will be the last sale of these works in a gallery.\nCatie Michel, Memoria\nKiah Butcher, Idle Hands // Idol Hands\nBell Projects, 2822 East 17th Avenue\nJanuary 5 to January 28 (Michel); January 5 to February 25 (Butcher)\nOpening Reception: Friday, January 5, 6 to 10 p.m.\nCatie Michel Artist Talk: Thursday, January 18, 6:30 p.m.\nBell Projects showcases Catie Michel’s multimedia storytelling project Memoria, for which she interviewed a group of female and binary subjects, piecing together personal stories drawn from their relationships to the natural world. Created thanks to a 2023 Sharon Prize for Colorado grant, Memoria took shape in a series of traditional platinum palladium print portraits overlaid with drawn, painted or reprinted imagery from nature and accompanied by recordings from the interviews. In the Living Room Gallery, curator and video artist Kiah Butcher’s two-channel video installation, Idle Hands // Idol Hands, playfully explores hands in repose in contrast to hands engaged in skilled dexterous activity.\nMoe Gram: I Just Wanna Have Fun\nAlto Gallery, 1900 35th Street, Suite B\nOpens Friday, January 5\nOpening Reception: Friday, January 5, 6 to 10 p.m.; register here\nCollage Workshop: Saturday, January 13, 1 to 3 p.m.\nHave fun with Moe Gram, who cuts off the unending flow of bad news long enough to remember joy, expressed through cheerful mixed-media layered collages.

These kids, who are more tuned in than their counterparts in any previous generation, know exactly what’s going on and have firm opinions about it.\nCounter Cowboy II, group show\nVisions West Contemporary, 2605 Walnut Street\nJanuary 5 through February 17\nStock Show season brings a wave of Western art to Denver this month, a veritable slam dunk for Visions West, which specializes in art with Western, outdoor and nature themes year-round. But the group show Counter Cowboy II speaks for itself: You’ll get your fill of cowboys and cowgirls, fancy Western dress and boots, mountain landscapes, spirited horses and wildlife.\nMixtape\nAccess Gallery, 909 Santa Fe\nJanuary 5 through February 17\nFirst Friday Reception: Friday, January 5\nMeet the Artists: Friday, January 19, 5 to 8 p.m.\nSilent Disco Closing Reception: Friday, February 16, 6 to 8 p.m.\nYoung artists with disabilities are the nonprofit Access Gallery’s reason to be, and more than thirty of them will be honored through their individual works and styles displayed in this 2024 all-gallery group show.

        "text": "ARIES (March 21-April 19): The plan I will propose in this horoscope is for temporary use. I’m not recommending you stick to it for all of 2024 — just for the next 15 to 18 days. If you do, I believe it will set you up for beautiful success in the coming months. Here’s my idea: Embark on a free-form extravaganza of playing and having fun. Just for now, set aside your ambition. Don’t worry about improving yourself and producing results. Simply enjoy a phase of suspending inhibitions, creatively messing around, having nothing to prove and being motivated by the quest for joy.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Climate change is impacting rainbows. Rising temperatures and dryer conditions mean that some parts of the world will get fewer rainbows and other areas will get more. Canada and Siberia will benefit, while the Mediterranean will be less well-endowed with sky-borne arcs of color that come from sunlit rain. But I predict that no matter where you live, the rainbow will be a potent and regular symbol for you Bulls in 2024 — more than ever before. That means you will have increased reasons to entertain hope and more power to find beauty. On occasion, there may even be very good luck at the metaphorical rainbow’s end. If you’re an LGBTQIA2S+ Taurus, be on high alert for breakthroughs in your ability to get the appreciation you deserve.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): As one of your inspirational stories for 2024, I offer this tale from singer-songwriter Tom Waits: “Once upon a time, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. They grew next to each other. Every day, the straight tree would look at the crooked tree and say, ‘You’re crooked. You’ve always been crooked, and you’ll continue to be crooked. But look at me! I’m tall, and I’m straight.’ Then one day, lumberjacks came to the forest and looked around. The manager in charge said, ‘Cut all the straight trees.’ And that crooked tree is still there to this day, growing strong and growing strange.” (PS: Here’s more from Gemini writer Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Be true to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant.”)\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Japanese artist Hokusai (1760-1849) developed a fascination for his country’s iconic Mount Fuji. In his seventies, he produced a series of woodblock prints titled “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji.” Later, he added three books of prints collectively called One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji. Some art historians say his obsession stemmed from the legend that the mountain was home to the secret of immortality. The coming year will be a fine time for you Cancerians to celebrate and concentrate on your own Mount Fuji-like passion. Sometime soon, identify what it is, and start making plans to commune with it intensely.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): If you will ever in your life go viral — that is, create or do something that suddenly becomes widely known and influential — I bet it will be in 2024. Even if you don’t produce TikTok videos seen by 10 million people, you are at least likely to become more visible in your local community or field of endeavor. Of course, I would prefer that your fame and clout spread because of the good deeds you do, not the weird deeds. I urge you to cultivate high integrity and a wildly generous spirit in the coming months. Be a role model who inspires and uplifts.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): I expect 2024 to be a free-spirited, wide-ranging, big-vision type of year for you, dear Virgo. I predict you will feel an abundance of urges to travel, roam and explore. You will be more excited than anxious about the prospect of leaving your comfort zone, and you will have a special fondness for getting your mind expanded by interesting encounters. That doesn’t mean you will avoid all awkwardness and confusion. Some of that stuff will happen, though it will usually evolve into educational adventures. And the extra good news is that wandering out in nature will provide even more inspiration and healing than usual. Treasure this quote from conservationist Rachel Carson: “Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure: the migration of the birds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the folded bud ready for the spring.”\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): I am pleased to inform you that a visit to hell will not be on your itinerary in 2024. You may be invited to take a few excursions into the realm that depth psychologists call the underworld, but that’s a good thing. There you will be able to hunt for treasures that have been hidden and uncover secrets that will illuminate your epic, months-long quest for wholeness. It may sometimes be dark and shadowy down there below, but almost always dark and shadowy in ways that will lead you to healing. (I will reiterate what I implied above: The underworld is NOT hell.)\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): I hope that working hard on togetherness will be a fun project for you in the coming months. To do it well, you must outgrow some habitual ways of doing friendship and intimacy. You will have to be imaginative and ingenious. Are you willing to believe that you do not yet know all there is to know about being a fantastic ally and partner? Are you ready to approach the arts of collaboration and cooperation as if enhancing your skills is the most important thing you can do? For the sake of your best selfish goals, be a brilliant teammate in 2024.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Each of us is a complex, kaleidoscopic work of art, whether or not we consciously approach our destiny in that spirit. Every day, we use our creative imagination to craft new elements of the masterpiece known as the story of our life. Leos come by this fun project naturally, but you Sagittarians also have great potential to embrace it with glee and panache. I trust you will be especially keen on enjoying this sacred work in 2024. And right now, today and in the coming weeks, will be an excellent time to ramp up the scintillating drama.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): “I am against sex education in schools because sex is more fun when it’s dirty and sinful.” So said Capricorn author Florence King. I reject and rebel against that perverse declaration and encourage you to disavow it, too, in 2024. In my astrological opinion, the coming months will be a favorable time to learn everything about sex and eros that you don’t already know. I hope you will dive deep as you gather a rich array of teachings about how to enjoy the art of making love more than ever before. Consider consulting tantric manuals like Margo Anand’s The Art of Sexual Magic: Cultivating Sexual Energy to Transform Your Life.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Singer-songwriter Tori Amos says she’s sure she was burned for being a witch in a previous lifetime. I suspect most of us had past incarnations in which we were punished simply for being our beautiful selves. I bring this up, Aquarius, because I think 2024 will be a favorable time to get some healing from any ancient hurt like that. You will have a series of experiences that could help you recover from the illusion that being faithful to your truth is somehow wrong. Life will conspire with you to help you reclaim more of the full audacity to be your gorgeous, genuine self.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): I believe 2024 will be one of the best years ever for your education. Your willingness and eagerness to learn will be at a peak. Your knack for attracting inspirational teachers will be excellent. It’s likely you will be exceptionally curious and open to good influences. My advice is to be alert for lessons not just from obvious sources of wisdom and revelation, but also from unexpected founts. Don’t be too sure you know where revelations and illumination might come from.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is under growing pressure to curb record numbers of migrants crossing into the United States — not just from the usual Republican critics, but also from Democratic mayors and governors in cities thousands of miles from the border.\nWhat used to be a clear-cut, ideological fight between Democrats and Republicans has become a bipartisan demand for action, and some of the most intense pressure on Biden is coming from places like Boston, Denver, Chicago and New York, where leaders in the president’s own party are issuing cries for help.\nPublicly, the Democratic politicians have described mounting crises in their cities. Privately, they are in almost daily contact with Tom Perez, director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and other administration officials. For the most part they are not calling for the kind of severe border restrictions that Republicans are demanding, but they want help with overflowing migrant encampments, packed shelters and busted budgets.\nThe intraparty pressure has turned the politics of immigration upside down at the beginning of a campaign year. And it has increased the likelihood that Biden and Democratic lawmakers will approve immigration concessions to Republicans that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago.\nIn Denver, more than 36,000 migrants have arrived in recent months, with 4,100 still in city shelters, and more are arriving daily. In Boston, migrants have camped out at the airport. In New York, more than 164,500 migrants have poured into shelters since April 2022, with many still living in one of the 215 hotels, converted office buildings or tent camps set up to accommodate them.\n“It’s both a humanitarian and fiscal crisis,” said Mike Johnston, the Democratic mayor of Denver. “We aren’t going to sit by and watch moms and 6-month-olds in tents on the streets in 10-degree weather. But by refusing to do that we are on the path to spend $180 million next year and could not do that either.”\n“As mayors we are so frustrated,” he added, noting that many of the migrants arriving in his city must wait for months before they can work legally in the United States. “This is actually a solvable problem, if we had work authorization, federal dollars and a coordinated entry plan.”\nThe flood of migrants into the big cities has been anything but coordinated.\nMost have arrived, unannounced, on buses or planes sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who argues that cities far from the border should get a taste of the flood of migrants in his state. Democratic mayors have lashed out at Abbott for what they say is a political stunt, using human beings as props.\nSo far, the stunt seems to have worked, by delivering the migrants — often without coats, or family members in the U.S. — to the cities far to the north.\nMayor Eric Adams of New York filed a lawsuit on Thursday against 17 charter bus companies seeking $708 million in compensation for transporting migrants from Texas to the city without paying “for the cost of continued care in violation of New York’s Social Services Law.” Last week, the mayor issued an executive order that requires buses with migrants to arrive in the city only between 8:30 a.m. and noon, Monday through Friday, or face fines and impoundment. Many buses have diverted to cities in New Jersey instead.\nIn Denver, Johnston was at one of the city’s migrant encampments on Wednesday, feeling upbeat that his team was transferring all 300 people, including some children, out of the cold and into shelters and apartments.\nBut even as the process was underway, several new busloads of migrants from the border arrived, courtesy of Abbott.\n“They literally pulled in as we were moving people from this encampment,” Johnston said in an interview.\nA record number of people worldwide are fleeing conflict, climate change, political turmoil and economic hardship in their homelands, according to the United Nations, and smuggling networks have expanded their reach to Asia and Africa.\nNearly 2.5 million people crossed the southern border in fiscal year 2023. In December, more than 10,000 migrants were intercepted at the southern border on some days, among the most ever. Many of them are boarding Abbott’s buses, hoping to find housing and work in the cities.\nThe anger at Abbott — and the frustration with the issue — is shared by Biden’s top aides, who regularly lash out at the Texas governor and other Republicans. On Wednesday, after Speaker Mike Johnson and 60 House Republicans gathered at the border to rail against the president and his immigration policies, the president’s spokesperson shot back.\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called the trip to the border the latest in a series of “political stunts” and accused Republicans of blocking “any efforts for the president to deal with the border. That’s what we’ve seen. That is what we’ve seen from the speaker.”\nWhite House officials say they have been in constant contact with the Democratic mayors and governors to try to help them deal with the impact of the migrants. Perez spends close to 50% of his time on the issue, according to a senior administration official familiar with his efforts.\n“The president is focused on securing additional resources,” Perez said, “including more Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges; more technology to catch fentanyl; and more grant funding for communities hosting recently arrived migrants.”\nThe federal government has already delivered about $1 billion to the cities most affected, including about $50 million of a promised $150 million to New York City. Biden has also asked Congress for another $1.4 billion to help cities around the country deal with migrants, but that emergency funding is tied up in debates on Capitol Hill.\nMayors and governors say it wouldn’t be enough anyway.\nNew York has already spent $3.1 billion on housing and feeding the migrants. Massachusetts has spent $247 million on emergency housing since July, and half of the current occupants are migrants. San Diego County allocated $3 million in October for a transition day center for migrants, and another $3 million in December. Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities across the country are also spending millions.\nSince August 2022, more than 600 buses have dropped migrants off in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs, and for months, migrant families have camped out in police stations or in tents on sidewalks.\nIn recent weeks, Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration has largely removed migrants from police stations and moved them to the 27 shelters throughout the city. More than 14,000 migrants are currently staying in shelters; Chicago has received nearly 30,000 migrants in just over 14 months.\nIn a New Year’s Eve interview, Johnson assailed Abbott’s actions but also renewed pressure on the Biden administration to send billions of dollars to the cities affected.\n“What we have is clearly an international and federal crisis that local governments are being asked to subsidize, and this is unsustainable,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “None of our local economies are positioned to be able to carry on such a mission.”\nOn Capitol Hill, a solution to the problem remains elusive.\nRepublicans have seized the moment to insist on new, severe restrictions to asylum and other immigration policies that Democrats have resisted for years. Lawmakers in both parties say they want more funding for border security but so far have been unable to reach agreement on how much and what it would be spent on.\nCaught in the middle are some of Biden’s top foreign policy priorities: military funding to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, along with money for Israel as it conducts a war against Hamas following the terror attacks on Oct. 7. Republicans have held up both priorities as border negotiations continue.\nBut the pressure on Biden is clearly having an effect on the legislative negotiations. White House officials have signaled that they are open to changes that would make it harder for asylum-seekers to pass an initial hurdle, known as a credible fear interview. If that happens, more of them will be returned home more quickly.\nDemocratic negotiators, including Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, also have appeared willing to discuss new rules that will allow more rapid deportations of migrants living illegally in the United States far from the border.\nThat would be a huge departure from the positions taken by most Democrats in the opening days and months of Biden’s presidency. But as the mayors and governors have made clear, the dynamics have changed.\n“States like Massachusetts are in desperate need of more support from the federal government to address this historic surge in migrant arrivals,” said Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts, a Democrat. “We need Congress to act on President Biden’s budget that includes critical funding for border security and for cities and states like ours.”\nc.2024 The New York Times Company",

        "text": "A pair of Oak Park-River Forest High School seniors have returned from an international field trip — and experience — they won’t soon forget, especially as they continue their individual efforts to address climate issues.\nKatie Stabb and Kate Wallace are concerned about the environment. That’s why they wanted to attend Conference of the Parties, or COP 28. The United Nations Climate Change Conference, as it is officially known, was held in Dubai Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, and the students attended Dec. 3 to Dec. 8.\nStabb, 18, and Wallace, 17, were part of a six-student delegation from It’s Our Future, a youth group to which they belong, that is part of Seven Generations Ahead, an organization dedicated to building healthy and sustainable communities.\n“I thought it would be a great opportunity to see how the process at conferences like this is carried out,” Stabb said about her desire to attend the international conference. “But also to meet people from so many different sectors who care about the environment and see what they do.”\nWallace said she has previously been involved in mock United Nations events.\n“I’m very interested in climate change and fighting the climate battle,” Wallace said. “So I was really interested in exploring the climate battle on an international stage, combining that with my little bit of United Nations background.”\nMore than 70,000 delegates attended the conference, including senior U.S. government officials the Department of State described as “working on issues related to the nexus of climate with conflict, food security, gender, global health, subnational diplomacy, youth, and more.”\nThe U.S. delegation was led by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Vice President Kamala Harris attended Dec. 1 and Dec. 2, according to the state department.\n“The sheer number of people and number of different professions and niche passions that are all contributing to environmental solutions is really amazing,” Stabb said. “I talked to a farmer, a chef, a psychologist. There’s such a wide variety of roles that need to be played in combating climate change.”\nStabb was particularly interested in talking with the psychologist who works with children of newly arrived immigrants in England.\n“She has them get in touch with their elders who are still back in their home country to learn about how they care for the land and the plants that they grow,” Stabb told Pioneer Press.\nThe goal is to have the children copy some of those practices that help the environment.\n“A big takeaway for me was the people and seeing that many,” Wallace said in an interview with Pioneer Press. “I think being there as a high schooler was very significant. We did meet some other youth but mostly college students. Also, seeing all the adults that are fighting for our generation … most of the people there aren’t going to see the impact that we are.”\nThe participants saw protests, including one about the need for increased funding for an environmental fund.\nStabb and Wallace attended a number of panel discussions and presentations on climate change at the conference. The chef Stabb met gave a presentation on how he uses wild plants that he forages in his recipes.\nWallace was particularly impressed with a tour of the largest single site solar park in the world.\n“It supplies 15% of Dubai’s electricity and it’s supposed to supply a quarter by 2030,” she said.\nStabb said that her goal after attending that conference is finding ways to get more people involved in protecting the environment.\n“There are so many things that people can do. We need to spread the word about that,” she said.\nOne way that young people can help is by urging their schools to create more sustainable cafeterias by providing more environmentally-friendly food, Stabb said.\nShe reported that Oak Park and River Forest High School already has a Sustainability Plan, addressing such issues as water use and energy use. It was created by members of the Environmental Club and the School Board.\n“The whole experience was very empowering and inspiring, seeing so many people fighting in different ways in their communities,” Wallace said of the trip to Dubai.\nOne of her goals is “bringing that energy and enthusiasm back and trying to inspire people in our community.”\nMyrna Petlicki is a freelancer.",

        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis and state administrators have rejected at least $11 billion in federal funds in the past few years, saying there were strings attached, they “politicized” roads or fought climate change.\nThe programs affected include an expansion of Medicaid, rebates for energy-saving appliances and upgrades, a program to cut motor vehicle emissions, and summer lunches for children from low-income families. Millions of mostly low-income Floridians could have benefited from the funding, the governor’s critics say.\nAs the Legislature convenes on Tuesday to build next year’s state budget, federal COVID-19 recovery funds that have fueled tax cuts, road projects and padded the state’s $10 billion rainy day fund are drying up. State economists warn of a slowdown in tax revenue over the next few years.\nAt the same time, DeSantis continues campaigning for the Republican nomination for president by railing against the federal government’s spending. He also says he wants to plow several billion more dollars into the state’s ample reserves, despite no recession in sight.\nDemocrats say they believe the governor’s main goal is to target President Joe Biden.\n“It’s so painful to watch as DeSantis turns people into political talking points against the Biden administration,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said. “He’ll do it regardless of how it hurts his constituents in Florida. And since he has no logical reason for rejecting those funds, it must be political.”\nBut DeSantis does take federal funding for the programs he wants. About one of every three dollars in the $114 billion budget he recommended to the Legislature comes from federal coffers.\n“He’s happy to take federal funds for police officer bonuses or … to score political points,” Driskell said. “But there is no real nuance to why he rejects so many funds that would help Floridians and take credit for that, too. He just wants to draw a distinction between himself and Biden.”\nDeSantis Press Secretary Jeremy Redfern has said that the governor has the right to veto or turn down programs he considers to be bad policy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks — sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation and concert tickets among them — cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”",

        "text": "Jacqueline Alemany/The Washington Post:\nReport: Trump businesses received $7.8 million in foreign payments during presidency\nThe report argues that the payments were in violation of the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, a provision that bars federal officials, including the president, from accepting money or gifts from foreign governments without permission from Congress. That clause was central to a protracted legal debate when Democrats controlled the House and sought access to Trump’s financial records. The issue eventually landed at the Supreme Court, but there was no definitive ruling on whether Trump illegally profited from his presidency. Instead, the justices in 2021 said the cases were moot because Trump no longer held office.\nNate Cohn/The New York Times:\nAmericans were angry with Truman because of high prices in the aftermath of World War II, even as other economic signals looked promising.\nIf there’s a time that might make sense of today’s political moment, postwar America might just be it. Many analysts today have been perplexed by public dissatisfaction with the economy, as unemployment and gross domestic product have remained strong and as inflation has slowed significantly after a steep rise. To some, public opinion and economic reality are so discordant that it requires a noneconomic explanation, sometimes called “vibes,” like the effect of social media or a pandemic hangover on the national mood.\nBut in the era of modern economic data, Harry Truman was the only president besides Joe Biden to oversee an economy with inflation over 7 percent while unemployment stayed under 4 percent and G.D.P. growth kept climbing. Voters weren’t overjoyed then, either. Instead, they saw Mr. Truman as incompetent, feared another depression and doubted their economic future, even though they were at the dawn of postwar economic prosperity.\nThe source of postwar inflation was fundamentally similar to post-pandemic inflation. The end of wartime rationing unleashed years of pent-up consumer demand in an economy that hadn’t fully transitioned back to producing butter instead of guns. A year after the war, wartime price controls ended and inflation skyrocketed. A great housing crisis gripped the nation’s cities as millions of troops returned from overseas after 15 years of limited housing construction. Labor unrest roiled the nation and exacerbated production shortages. The most severe inflation of the last 100 years wasn’t in the 1970s, but in 1947, reaching around 20 percent.\nAccording to the historian James T. Patterson, “no domestic issue of these years did Truman more damage than the highly contentious question of what to do about wartime restraints on prices.”\nSuffolk still relies on phone calls (cell and landline), nothing online.\nTwo good pollsters weigh in:\nJohn Stoehr/The Editorial Board:\nDemocracy isn’t a hostage crisis\nWe have a choice.\nAn elected state official made a decision based on statute and material circumstances. An interested party objected, appealing to a higher authority. That authority (a court of law) may or may not decide. It depends. But what’s certain is that this legal process is inherently democratic. If it were antidemocratic, there would be no appeal. Indeed, Trump would have no right to an appeal. He does. So it is.\nThat this legal process is inherently democratic should be blindingly obvious to respectable people (ie, the pundit corps) who expressed their concerns about the state of democracy in America in the wake of decisions made in Maine and Colorado to disqualify Donald Trump.\nThe question, for me, is why isn’t it blindingly obvious? Why are respectable members of the pundit corps not seeing the plain truth? I think the answer can be found in human psychology. Fear is why.\nBolts magazine:\nTwelve Questions Shaping Democracy and Voting Rights in 2024\nOpportunities abound for states to ease ballot access and voter registration this year. But the specter of major showdowns over the results of the November elections also looms.\nOur team at Bolts has identified a dozen key questions that will shape voting rights and democracy this year. This is born less of a desire to be comprehensive than to offer a preliminary roadmap for our own coverage.\nThat’s because, while some questions that matter to 2024 will come down to federal decisions—likely starting with decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court on Donald Trump’s prosecutions and presence on the ballot, and on the VRA’s fate—a lot will hinge on the policies and politics of state and local governments: your county clerk in charge of organizing Election Day, your county board that decides where to put ballot drop boxes, your lawmakers tweaking the rules of ballot initiatives, your secretary of state wielding the power to certify results. (Be sure to explore our state-by-state resources on who runs our elections and who counts our elections.)\nThese are the officials we will be tracking throughout the year to help us clarify the local landscape of voting rights and access to democracy during a critical election year.\nThe Washington Post:\nA quarter of Americans believe FBI instigated Jan. 6, Post-UMD poll finds\nMore than 3 in 10 Republicans have adopted the falsehood that the FBI conspired to cause the Capitol riot\nTwenty-five percent of Americans say it is “probably” or “definitely” true that the FBI instigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, a false concept promoted by right-wing media and repeatedly denied by federal law enforcement, according to a new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.\nThe Post-UMD poll finds a smaller 11 percent of the public overall thinks there is “solid evidence” that FBI operatives organized and encouraged the attack, while 13 percent say this is their “suspicion only.”\nAmong Republicans, 34 percent say the FBI organized and encouraged the insurrection, compared with 30 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats.\nJill Lawrence/The Bulwark:\nMcConnell’s Two Big Legacies: The End of Roe and the Forever Grip of Trump\nThe Senate Republican’s power plays haven’t turned out as planned.\nThe longest-serving party leader in Senate history, McConnell has wielded power ruthlessly to advance conservative goals. Yet it is increasingly clear that his legacy, so tightly intertwined with Donald Trump’s, has been built on a foundation of political miscalculations.\nThe conservative Supreme Court he and Trump co-created to overturn Roe’s longstanding constitutional right to abortion has triggered a sustained voter backlash across red states and blue. The entire country, meanwhile, remains trapped and threatened by the Republican party’s inability to move past Trump—even after he fomented a multi-front attack on democracy to stay in power.\nTrump is now charged with 91 counts in four criminal indictments, two of them related to his “Big Lie” that he won the 2020 election and his alleged attempts to subvert it. As the 2024 primary season begins, polling shows that he’s on track to capture the GOP nomination for the third time, with even odds of winning his desperation play: a return to the White House, where he can deploy all the levers, authorities, and shields of the presidency to end his legal troubles or at least disappear them over a distant, perhaps posthumous, horizon.\nThe longer all of this goes on, the more McConnell—who was Senate majority leader when Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol—bears the burden of not stopping it, or at least trying, when he could have and should have.\nPaul Waldman/MSNBC:\nThe real reason Mike Johnson chaperoned 60 House Republicans at the border\nRepublicans treat these jaunts to the border as accomplishments in themselves, far more meaningful than any legislative response.\nGiven this toxic stew of silliness and bad faith with which Republicans approach a complicated policy issue that they claim to care about above all others, you’d think the White House and congressional Democrats would be roasting them mercilessly. They’d be telling the public that only one party is serious about immigration, and it isn’t the one that shouts the loudest about it.\nIf only that were true. Instead, the White House and Democrats seem helpless as Republicans insist on blocking President Joe Biden’s request for more Ukraine funding — or even funding for the government as a whole — unless it is joined to radical immigration policy changes that they know Democrats won’t tolerate. The result may be no more help for Ukraine, and it certainly won’t be anything to address the problems at the border. Which is just fine with Republicans.\nRasmus Nielsen/Financial Times:\nForget technology — politicians pose the gravest misinformation threat\nAs we head into a big election year, beware the risks of misleading statements from those at very top\nIn the US, the Washington Post stopped counting after documenting at least 30,573 false or misleading claims made by Donald Trump as president. In the UK, the non-profit FullFact has reported that as many as 50 MPs — including two prime ministers, cabinet ministers and shadow cabinet ministers — failed to correct false, unevidenced or misleading claims in 2022 alone, despite repeated calls to do so.\nThese are actual problems of misinformation, and the phenomenon is not new. Both George W Bush and Barack Obama’s administrations obfuscated on Afghanistan. Bush’s government and that of his UK counterpart Tony Blair advanced false and misleading claims in the run-up to the Iraq war. Prominent politicians have, over the years, denied the reality of human-induced climate change, proposed quack remedies for Covid-19, and so much more. These are examples of misinformation, and, at their most egregious, of disinformation — defined as spreading false or misleading information for political advantage or profit.\nThis basic point is strikingly absent from many policy documents — the NCSC report, for example, has nothing to say about domestic politics. It is not alone.\nFrom Cliff Schecter, with Bob Cesca:",

        "text": "Deforestation In Brazilian Amazon Halved In 2023\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by half last year, according to figures released Friday, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government bolstered environmental policing to crack down on surging destruction.\nHowever, the news was far less bright from the crucial Cerrado savanna below the rainforest, where clear-cutting hit a new annual record last year, rising by 43 percent from 2022, according to the national space research agency's DETER surveillance program.\nSatellite monitoring detected 5,152 square kilometers (nearly 2,000 square miles) of forest cover destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last year, down 50 percent from 2022.\nThat still represented a loss 29 times the size of Washington DC in Brazil's share of the world's biggest rainforest, whose carbon-absorbing trees play a vital role in curbing climate change.\nMeanwhile, the Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot whose ecosystems are intricately linked with the Amazon's, lost over 7,800 square kilometers of native vegetation last year, the highest since monitoring began in 2018.\n\"We saw some important victories on the environment in 2023. The significant reduction in deforestation in the Amazon was a highlight,\" said Mariana Napolitano of environmental group WWF-Brasil.\n\"But unfortunately we aren't seeing the same trend in the Cerrado... That is harming the biome and the extremely important ecosystem services it provides. And we saw the impact at the end of the year, with extremely high temperatures.\"\nEnvironmental groups have accused the Lula government of turning a blind eye to the destruction of the lesser-known Cerrado to appease the powerful agribusiness lobby.\nThe figures for both the Amazon and Cerrado were updated through December 29.\nTaken together, the total area razed in the two regions was 12,980 square kilometers in 2023, down 18 percent from 2022.\nAfter beating far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in a divisive election in 2022, veteran leftist Lula returned to office on January 1, 2023, vowing \"Brazil is back\" as a partner in the fight against climate change.\nAgribusiness ally Bolsonaro (2019-2022) had drawn international criticism for presiding over a 75-percent increase in average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon versus the previous decade.\nExperts say the destruction in both the Amazon and Cerrado is driven mainly by farming and cattle ranching in Brazil, the world's top exporter of soybeans and beef.\n© Copyright AFP 2023.

He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks — sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation and concert tickets among them — cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”",

        "text": "‘The Curse’: Nathan Fielder Proves He Can Hold His Own With Emma Stone\nThis post contains spoilers for this week’s episode of The Curse, which is now streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime.\nPrior to this week, The Curse allowed the many problems in the Seigel marriage, and in the production of Fliplanthropy, to gradually simmer. With the penultimate episode, “Young Hearts,” all aspects of Whitney and Asher’s lives come to a full boil.\nWhitney first went into the HGTV show with two goals: to make a killing in local real estate, and to publicly establish a do-gooder identity that’s in sharp contrast to the reputation of her slumlord parents. Over the course of the season, she’s discovered an unexpected third benefit: with the help of Dougie, she hopes to use Fliplanthropy as an escape hatch out of a marriage she no longer wants to be a part of. (Assuming she ever did, outside of seeing it as another way to rebel against mom and dad.) Early in “Young Hearts,” we see that she now wants to go even further than Dougie when it comes to humiliating Asher on camera, laying the groundwork for their inevitable divorce.\nBut when Martha from HGTV arrives in Española, Whitney discovers a major flaw in her plan: the network bought an upbeat show about a happy couple trying to make the world a better place, and Martha wants no part of letting it turn into the reality TV equivalent of Scenes from a Marriage.\nMartha also wants to downplay the gentrification angle, and all the talk about the local non-white communities, and just focus on Whitney’s passion for fighting climate change. This is a familiar line from executives, and not always an unreasonable one: you don’t want to overcomplicate things, especially at first. But it’s yet another example of Whitney surrendering her principles, one by one, in pursuit of this thing that she believes is finally going to make the world love her.\nThis means that she has to attempt to mend fences with Asher, even if he’s for the most part unaware of how unhappy she is with him, not to mention what she’s been plotting with Dougie. As always, Whitney is ready, willing, and able to put on a false front if it will get her what she thinks she wants. So she and Asher go out for a bowling date, and she at least seems to be having a great time. (Emma Stone is herself one of the most convincing actors in the business right now when it comes to playing wild enthusiasm, so she’s perfect for a sequence like this.) And Asher in turn attempts to impress her further by confessing to Bill that he leaked the video to local news. He tries to give himself a big hero moment by turning Bill’s insult around on him, bragging, “Actually, I am a tool, ’cause tools fix things.” But Asher is who Asher is, and later the encounter becomes just another piece of his cuckolding fantasies about Whitney.\nEditor’s picks\nWhitney’s response when she overhears Asher suggests that this fetish is another aspect of her life that she has long pretended to enjoy. But in other ways, she’s pretending to herself at least as much as she is to the rest of the world. She tries confronting her parents after getting a close look at one of their many unsafe, oppressive properties, but they’re unmoved, and her mother accuses Whitney of playing dress-up with the persona she’s crafted for herself. And she continues to try to buy Cara’s friendship, in this case giving her a huge tip for a massage she doesn’t even get when she realizes that Cara will be her masseuse(*).\n(*) Abshir and his family are again absent — the show is really not interested in them as characters, unfortunately — but it’s interesting to think about his nightmarish trip to the chiropractor compared to the posh spa where Whitney is preparing to get a relaxing massage.\nAll of this builds to the climactic sequence where Whitney — prompted by Asher noticing that the contract has been altered, essentially to prevent him from suing anyone when the show winds up portraying him in such a negative light — decides to show him the latest cut of an episode. We get an even lengthier glimpse of the show (now using the Green Queen title) than we did earlier in the season. It’s highly polished in the manner of most of these kinds of shows, but it also dwells so much on Whitney’s passion for local culture that you can begin to understand Martha’s concerns in that area. In the moment, though, Whitney doesn’t care about any of that. She just wants to use the footage as a way to confess her true feelings to Asher. And when the message doesn’t seem to be entirely getting across, she insists that Dougie show him the material they already cut out, about the pottery, his cell phone, and her more explicit and harsh comments about her husband.\nRelated\nLike so many of Whitney’s schemes, the result is not at all what she was expecting. Though Asher storms out of Dougie’s hotel room, he returns moments later, giving a slow clap and admitting that he had been feeling the same qualms about their marriage for a long time. He recognizes that Nala never really cursed him, and that he has brought all these terrible things upon himself. “It’s not magic!” he acknowledges. “It’s me! I’m a bad person, and I’ve been dragging you down with me, OK?” Whitney is stunned to hear him say that he still wants to be with her after that, but it’s not a familiar romcom moment where his resolve changes her feelings toward him. As Asher keeps talking and talking — including the suggestion that, should he recognize in time that she still doesn’t want to be with him, “I would feel it, and I would disappear” — the main emotion on her face is fear. He is being both dominant and submissive at the same time, once again placing her in the power position of their marriage, but with such intensity that she doesn’t feel she can do anything but agree. As is the case at the bowling alley with Bill, Asher thinks he is being the hero of the story, but nothing comes out the way he intends it to. He thinks, for instance, that it’s a compelling argument to remind Whitney that they often like to say that they’re so good on paper, because it ignores how stifling she finds the actuality of their marriage. He promises her that, “The world will know Whitney Seigel,” which is the exact thing she so obviously and desperately wants, but the way in which he’s saying it makes the prospect seem far less appealing to her. And by the end, when he’s murmuring, “That’s a good girl,” he’s all but refusing to let her go, as if she’s an unruly pet he knows he can tame.\nTrending\nIt is perhaps the most disturbing scene yet in a series that’s been full of them, and certainly the most intense. Nathan Fielder has the lightest acting resume of the main trio, but he’s terrific here going toe-to-toe with Stone, verbally bulldozing her while all she can do is try to absorb and understand everything he’s saying.\nIt’s a terrific episode, easily the highlight of The Curse so far.",

        "text": "America is facing its greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. I know, journalists exaggerate sometimes. But as rock critic Greil Marcus said of punk rock half a century ago, this is actually happening. And if sanity doesn’t prevail, this crisis will affect all of our lives, whether we are paying attention to it or not.\nIs this really “unprecedented,” as journalists like to say? Here’s the evidence. There has never been a major presidential candidate on trial, let alone charged with 91 criminal counts in four cases, as well as a massive civil fraud case against his business. Our Constitution doesn’t provide for this situation. There has never been a presidential candidate who attempted a coup, or whatever it is that former President Donald Trump tried to do on Jan. 6, 2021; and while the 14th Amendment bans someone who has “engaged in insurrection or rebellion,” state courts are divided on whether that applies to Trump. And there has never been a presidential candidate who has proposed specifically unconstitutional and undemocratic actions, as Trump has now promised to undertake.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, there has never been a time at which at least a third of the country believes lies as big as the ones Trump continues to tell: that the 2020 election was stolen from him by massive fraud, that there is a vast governmental and media conspiracy against him, that all the charges are fake. The Constitution never contemplated such a vast campaign of mass deception; in its day, landed white men wrote pamphlets for one another.\nAll of this is new, and frankly, our country isn’t made for this — not for the Trump candidacy, and even less for a second Trump presidency. The Constitution can’t stop him, the criminal justice system can’t stop him, and sane Republican voters can’t stop him. His second campaign, and potential second term, will test bedrock American principles like at no other time in our history. And when these multiple raging fronts crash together, nobody can say for sure if our system will hold together. Here are the four challenges America will face this year and what might (or might not) stop an avowed authoritarian from leading the country.\n1. The Constitution Won’t Stop Trump\nLet’s start with Trump’s latest legal challenge (but, due to the way it’s being considered, potentially the first that will be resolved), which is the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling (echoed by the Secretary of State of Maine) that Trump “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” and is barred from office by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\nIn a 133-page opinion, the court laid out a persuasive case for why Trump’s conduct before, during, and after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol qualifies as an “insurrection.” But as persuasive as that case may be, it’s hard to believe that this particular Supreme Court will endorse it.\nFirst, millions of voters would see this as the greatest judicial power grab in American history, even if the “grab” is really the court exercising its constitutionally-granted authority. It is arguably even more dramatic than the Bush v. Gore decision of 2000, because the court would be throwing a major-party frontrunner off the ballot in all 50 states before a vote is even tallied. This would be bigger than the Watergate cases, Dred Scott, Roe, or Brown. It would be historic, and would likely lead to violence.\nFor this reason, any justice would proceed cautiously, giving as much benefit of the doubt to Trump as possible. Even if the court weren’t dominated by conservatives, a case of this magnitude isn’t played out on a level playing field. And there is a lot of room for interpretation. Must a disqualified official be convicted of insurrection? No one has ever decided that; Trump’s defenders say yes, his opponents say no. Is the president a “public official” covered by the text of the 14th Amendment? Probably, but again, no one has ever decided that. It’s hard to see the Supreme Court making so much new law in such a high-profile case.\nSecond, this Court is dominated by “originalists,” who espouse an interpretive theory that tries to define ambiguous terms according to how they would have been understood at the time they were written — 1865, in this case. At that time, the meaning of “insurrection” was clear: The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the Civil War, and was directed at former Confederates. As bad as they were, is Jan. 6, and Trump’s months-long campaign to overturn the 2020 election, really like the Civil War? On the other hand, even some conservative law professors have noted that, during the Civil War era, the term “insurrection” was understood broadly.\nAnd then there are the partisans, like Justice Clarence Thomas, whose own wife was in frequent communication with the insurrectionists on Jan. 6. If there were any binding ethics rules at the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas would have to recuse himself from this case. But there aren’t and he won’t.\nYou, I, or some esteemed state court justices may well answer those questions in a way that would block Trump from office. But it doesn’t matter what we think. It matters what at least five Supreme Court justices think, because they’re the ones who will decide if the 14th Amendment requires states to throw Trump off the ballot.\nAnd what are the chances of that? Zero. Trump will be on the ballot.\n2. The MAGA Base Will Still Vote for a Felon\nNow let’s look at those four criminal cases. On the face of it, this situation is at once absurd and, yes, unprecedented. No former president has ever been criminally charged before. And while Trump’s legal strategy in all the cases has been to delay everything as long as possible, it’s quite possible that at least some of these cases will be resolved before the election.\nFirst, Trump faces 40 federal charges related to stealing classified documents, which would be a slam-dunk case were it not for the judge in charge of it, Judge Aileen Cannon, who is not merely a Trump appointee but who has issued several questionable decisions indicating a strong bias in Trump and the MAGA movement’s favor. The trial is scheduled for May, but expect it to be delayed.\nSecond is the federal election interference case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith, in which Trump is accused of fraudulently trying to create slates of fake electors and pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to recognize them (or at least delay the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory). This trial is set for March, if Trump is not found to be immune from prosecution. He has argued that his statements and actions constitute protected free speech.\nThird is the Georgia election interference case, in which Trump and numerous co-conspirators are charged with racketeering, forgery, soliciting public officers to violate their oaths of office, and other crimes, all in connection with the 2020 election. This case is least likely to be heard before the election, but it has a twist: Since it’s a state case, it can be tried and heard even if Trump is president.\nFinally, Trump faces 34 charges in a New York criminal case about falsifying business records to conceal hush money paid to Stormy Daniels (probably the weakest case of the four), and is a party to a civil case about widespread fraud at the Trump Organization that may shut down his business for good.\nSo, it is entirely foreseeable, and even likely at this point, that Trump’s unprecedented trial for attempting to overturn the 2020 election will begin on March 4, 2024, and then the next day — Super Tuesday — he will lock up the Republican nomination for president. It is even possible (though less likely) that he will be found guilty of some of the federal or state charges against him in 2024, and will be running for president as a convicted felon. (It’s unlikely that he’ll be literally sitting in jail, as he will surely appeal any conviction.)\nAnd if he wins? This would be new territory, constitutionally speaking. Presumably, Trump will immediately call off all the federal cases against him (itself a constitutional crisis that the Constitution does not contemplate), and it’s not clear whether he’ll comply with Georgia’s state case,or with court orders against him. Not since Marbury v. Madison (1803) has the rule of law been so threatened.\nNow, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. But the more you dig into these cases, the more the evidence accumulates that Donald Trump has engaged in massive criminal activity and tried to steal an election. Any other candidate would have withdrawn from the race under such a cloud.\nBut not Trump. Rather, aided by right-wing media’s greed and Republican politicians’ fear, he has convinced nearly a third of the country that all of this is just a “witch hunt,” to use his favorite phrase, and that the core institutions of civil society — the courts, the so-called “deep state,” responsible news media, scientific and academic institutions — are part of a vast conspiracy theory to undermine America.\nFor the MAGA base, the charges against Trump are evidence not of Trump’s guilt, but of the judicial system’s corruption. Each successive indictment shows that the deep state, liberal elites, and/or global pedophile ring are out to get Trump, and each successive episode only seems to deepen that resolve. It’s not even politics anymore, so much as sociology and psychology: a classic example of groupthink, a cult of personality, and the way demagogues can weaponize the angriest and most reactive aspects of human nature. MAGA rage reflects a profound spiritual rot, and if you have these people in your family, you know how cancerous it is. It cannot be dislodged. It is a flaw in human psychology. It is appalling.\nWhether Trump wins or loses, this cancerous mistrust of how we distinguish true and false, friend from foe, will last for decades. There’s no both-sidesing this conspiratorial mindset: Sure, the Left has its extremes too, but this paranoid conspiracy theorizing has captured the Republican party, aided by increasingly incendiary rhetoric that would be unthinkable even a decade ago. This isn’t going away.\n3. Sane Republicans Have No Control of the Situation\nNow, the MAGA base is not the same as the Republican Party. Actually, the GOP is composed of three, roughly equal parts: the populist base; Christian conservatives (who often overlap with the base); and the basically normal conservatives, plutocrats, quasi-libertarians, and moderates who controlled the party from World War II until 2016. So will the sane Republicans stop him?\nNo.\nHere’s a funny thing about dictators: They often take power with only a minority of public support. To start with the most infamous, Adolf Hitler lost his last real election, coming in second place to German president Paul von Hindenburg in 1932. Even when the Nazi party gained power in parliament, causing Hindenburg to appoint Hitler chancellor in January, 1933, they had only won 37 percent of the popular vote.\nAnd if you look at history, there has always been some share of American and European populations — usually between 15 and 30 percent — who have supported right-wing populist nationalism. Know-Nothing nativists in the 19th century. The jingoistic nationalism around World War I. The Christian Front and American pro-Nazi sympathizers in the 1930s. McCarthyism. The John Birch Society. For all of American history, there has been a reactionary far-right movement in America, often animated by fundamentalist religion, obsessed with the populist fever dream that the real America is being undermined by shadowy outsiders within. It is the “paranoid style of American politics,” as Richard Hofstadter observed in the McCarthy Era. And it has never gone away.\nRoughly the same percentage of people in European countries today support hard-right, know-nothing, anti-intellectual nativist populists: neo-fascists in Italy, Orban’s nationalists in Hungary, anti-immigrant reactionaries in France.\nThe trouble is that sometimes these people actually win elections, especially when the opposition is divided. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Republican primary with 44 percent of the votes, and would happen again this year even if Trump’s various opponents together won a majority of votes (which they are currently not projected to do anyway).Thanks to efforts by MAGA Republicans, most GOP primaries are “winner take all,” so if Trump wins only 40 percent of the vote in Florida, say, he gets 100 percent of Florida’s delegates. Even if his opponents wanted to unite against him at the convention, they wouldn’t be able to do so. Trump has the GOP nomination in the bag.\nAnd then comes the general election, which Trump could win even with a minority of the popular votes if enough left-wing and independent voters disenchanted with Biden either vote for a third-party candidate or just stay home. And then there’s electoral college, an anti-democratic constitutional compromise made to secure slaveholding states’ entry into the union. The electoral college favored those states (electors are allocated based on population, not the number of voters), and today favors smaller states that tend to be more conservative. It’s no coincidence that the two times a popular vote loser won the electoral college in the last hundred years, that candidate was a Republican.\nAnd part of the problem is that Trump speaks to the deep resentment, fear, and loss of status that many white Americans have experienced over the last few decades. Ironically, he couples this populist demagoguery with plutocratic fiscal policies — his tax cuts enriched the 1 percent more than any single tax measure in American history. But no one pays attention to that. His supporters feel he speaks for them, speaks like them, captures their patriotism, outrage and resentment in a way no pencil-pushing moderate ever will. Like the authoritarians named above, Trump whips up fury and rides it to electoral success.\nMeanwhile, Trump is aided and abetted by a right-wing media ecosystem that, as the Dominion Voting Systems case showed, is apparently motivated primarily by ratings and money. The greed of the Murdoch family alone will go down in history as one of the great betrayals of civil responsibility. They know this guy’s a grifter, a criminal, and a cheat, and sometimes they say so out loud. Yet they continue to spread the lies that benefit him.\nEven if only a minority of Americans buy into it.\n4. If Trump Wins, America Will Never Be the Same\nSo, in 2024, things will get weird: We’re looking at multiple potential criminal trials of a presidential candidate, a cascade of incendiary rhetoric, and an incumbent president who many Americans either dislike or simply believe is too old to serve another term.\nNow, there is one ray of hope. Trump’s indictments (and perhaps convictions) may rile up the base, but they alienate moderates and independents. And there is now strong polling data to suggest that if Trump is convicted of serious crimes, enough swing voters will turn against him that he will lose the election.\nBut if he wins, Trump’s radical plans for 2025 will reshape the country in ways that represent perhaps the most profound constitutional crisis of all.\nDon’t take my word for it. Read about Project 2025, the MAGA right’s plan to purge thousands of civil servants and replace them with party loyalists, to take a “wrecking ball to the administrative state,” to end the Department of Justice’s independence and indict Trump’s political enemies, and to roll back all climate crisis mitigation measures that have been put into place. Read about the MAGA Right’s planned assault on science at the CDC, EPA, and other agencies, and its attacks on higher education. Pay attention to what these people are planning to do. Ponder the effects of these plans on immigrants, the courts, racial justice, trans kids, abortion rights, economic inequality and insecurity (particularly for young people), the role of science, higher education, and foreign policy, in which American isolationism and idiocy mean that Putin and Xi gain power on the global stage. Or just ponder the climate crisis: 2023 was the hottest year on record, but Trump and MAGA media outlets are still denying that climate change is even real, and Trump has promised to double-down on coal and other fossil fuels. It’s staggering.\nI admit that, despite my own significant amounts of privilege, I may be in denial about the possibility of Trump winning. As a queer person, I worry about my family, whether my same-sex marriage will be protected, whether my parental rights will continue or not, whether my trans friends will be able to access health care. As a rabbi, I worry about the increase in antisemitism (which is still much worse on the Far Right than on the Far Left) and Trump’s proximity to white supremacists like Nick Fuentes. As a journalist, I worry about Trump’s promise to “come after the people in the media, who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig the elections, we’re going to come after you.” But maybe all that fear is good… once it spreads.\nRemember, the Biden campaign is playing a waiting game. They aren’t making their case yet; they’re not going on the attack until the election season gets going in earnest. And I think once they do, people will pay attention. After all, precisely the populations who would be most harmed by Trump — people of color, younger people, people living with financial precarity, immigrants — are often the most alienated from the political process right now. Often this is for very good reasons: they may be turned off by the gerontocracy on both sides of the aisle, or angry about Biden’s policies on Israel/Palestine, or well aware that even liberal economic policies won’t stop the crushing loss of opportunity that young people face every day. Or they may simply be too exhausted, distracted, or focused on getting through the day.\nBut when the stakes of this election are more clear, they will put aside their entirely justified qualms and vote accordingly. This isn’t some policy disagreement, or some facile claim that there’s no difference between the two major parties. This is a profound national and constitutional crisis, and I really believe that folks will rise to the occasion when the occasion demands it.\nAt least, I hope we will.",

        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis and state administrators have rejected at least $11 billion in federal funds in the past few years, saying there were strings attached, they “politicized” roads or fought climate change.\nThe programs affected include an expansion of Medicaid, rebates for energy-saving appliances and upgrades, a program to cut motor vehicle emissions, and summer lunches for children from low-income families. Millions of mostly low-income Floridians could have benefited from the funding, the governor’s critics say.\nAs the Legislature convenes on Tuesday to build next year’s state budget, federal COVID-19 recovery funds that have fueled tax cuts, road projects and padded the state’s $10 billion rainy day fund are drying up. State economists warn of a slowdown in tax revenue over the next few years.\nAt the same time, DeSantis continues campaigning for the Republican nomination for president by railing against the federal government’s spending. He also says he wants to plow several billion more dollars into the state’s ample reserves, despite no recession in sight.\nDemocrats say they believe the governor’s main goal is to target President Joe Biden.\n“It’s so painful to watch as DeSantis turns people into political talking points against the Biden administration,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell said. “He’ll do it regardless of how it hurts his constituents in Florida. And since he has no logical reason for rejecting those funds, it must be political.”\nBut DeSantis does take federal funding for the programs he wants. About one of every three dollars in the $114 billion budget he recommended to the Legislature comes from federal coffers.\n“He’s happy to take federal funds for police officer bonuses or … to score political points,” Driskell said. “But there is no real nuance to why he rejects so many funds that would help Floridians and take credit for that, too. He just wants to draw a distinction between himself and Biden.”\nDeSantis Press Secretary Jeremy Redfern has said that the governor has the right to veto or turn down programs he considers to be bad policy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDepending on the uptick in enrollment, Medicaid expansion would bring at least $4 billion from Washington to the state if 700,000 to 1 million enroll. The state would also get an additional $2 billion over the next two years as an incentive offered to holdout states.\nTo receive that federal money, the state would have to provide about a 10% match, which DeSantis and Republicans complain is a condition that would cost too much.\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are losing health care coverage since the continuous enrollment policy enacted during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic ended last year. About a quarter million of those Floridians are children.\nDeSantis also forfeited about $5 billion in food benefits aimed at families struggling during the pandemic by opting out of an emergency allotment two years before it expired in March.\nThe state missed the Jan.1 deadline to get $248 million for a summer food program for 2 million children. The state would have had to pay a $12 million matching fee for administrative costs, but officials said their existing food programs were adequate and worried about “strings” attached to the federal funding.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue turned down $320 million in federal funds to cut down on exhaust emissions from cars and trucks, calling the program an example of government overreach and “the continued politicization of our roadways.” Florida was the only state to turn down the funding.\nThose grants also would have helped the DOT expand parking spaces for semitrailers at rest stops along the state’s highways along with the other measures to fight emissions most scientists have linked to climate change.\nIn July, DeSantis vetoed $30 million that would have made $346 million in federal funding available to Florida to give rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances and making energy-saving electrical upgrades to people’s homes.\nDeSantis rejected the program at first because it includes measures that address climate change. But facing public pressure to reverse this decision, DeSantis has asked for $1.7 million to administer the program next year. State officials won’t say how much of the $346 million that amount of money would draw.\nState leaders also turned down a $400 million program for low-income families to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.\n“This is more money Gov. DeSantis and the Republican supermajority left on the table,” U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, a Central Florida Democrat, said previously. “All this is doing is hurting poor people.”\nSoto has a bill before Congress that would allow local governments to apply for the $346 million energy program and distribute it themselves.\nThe state also left an estimated $499 million in federal funds on the table by not spending $290 million budgeted for services for the disabled, according to an analysis by The ARC, a nonprofit group representing people with disabilities.\nARC officials said that was enough to provide services to the 23,000 children and adults who qualify for care but remain on a waiting list due to a lack of services.\nState officials disputed ARC’s study, saying the agency returned to state coffers $145 million that wasn’t spent on services for the disabled as the Legislature intended. Once that money was put into a reserve account, it could no longer be used for ongoing benefits.\n“By continuing to opt out of federal funding for essential programs for Florida families, like health coverage, disability services, mental health funding, climate resiliency programs, and more, the state not only continually sends billions of our tax dollars to other states, but also prevents improvements in quality of life for thousands of Floridians,” said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer of the Florida Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\nThe $11 billion is money Floridians send up to Washington when they pay income taxes. It often will go to other states if Florida doesn’t take it.\nState economist Amy Baker warned lawmakers in November that the three-year outlook for state revenue is slowing.\nOne-time or short-term tax breaks — sales tax holidays for back to school, hurricane preparation and concert tickets among them — cost the state coffer’s $541 million, she said.\n“We expect to be lower in terms of revenue collection than last year, [due to the state] adopting measures that affect revenues like tax holidays and other measures coming out of session at a record-setting pace,” Baker said.\nThe three-year outlook shows a year-end surplus dropping from $7 billion to $2.7 billion, she said, in part because of the billions of dollars in one-time funding the federal government sent to Florida during the pandemic that has stopped flowing.\nSpending all that money now could mean no surplus available down the road, she said. No budget approach changes are needed in the short run, she told lawmakers.\nBut, she added, “there is a cautionary note or warning note that that balance is dropping that much over the three years.”",

        "text": "Washington voters want more social services and less taxes, poll finds\nA new poll shows the majority of Washington voters want legislators to invest this year in social services such as mental health, schools, reducing homelessness and combating climate change. They also want some taxes repealed.\nThis year’s legislative session kicks off Monday in Olympia, and legislators are working with an unexpected $1 billion in extra revenue from the state’s new capital gains tax and carbon auction program.\nThe 2024 edition of the annual Crosscut/Elway legislative preview poll was released Thursday. In it, 84% of voters indicated they want the government to fund behavioral health programs and combat the statewide opioid epidemic.\nThe poll also found about 57% of voters simultaneously favored repealing the state’s new capital gains tax. A voter initiative proposing that repeal is poised to land on the November ballot.\nEvery year, pollsters with Elway Research Inc. ask registered voters in Washington to list their top legislative priorities ahead of the state’s legislative session. A total of 403 registered voters from across Washington were selected at random for this year’s poll and responded to questions via telephone.\nPollster Stuart Elway presented his findings at an event in Olympia Thursday. Elway has been conducting polls since the early 1980s, and he said one sentiment has always rung true for the majority of voters:\n“More people have been optimistic about their own household than for the country,” Elway said. “This is a typical pattern. Things are going well at my house, but the country is going (poorly).”\nThe top issue voters want state lawmakers to focus on for the third straight year is the economy, according to the poll. Some type of economic issue was the top concern of 32% of voters. Specifically, cost of living and inflation were the most chosen issues. The issues of public safety and homelessness tied for the next most popular, followed by taxes, government, education and the environment.\nFor voters, police pursuits were another high-priority issue. About 66% of poll respondents reported they want to eliminate some restrictions on when police can pursue criminal suspects in cars.\nLast year, the Legislature passed a bill that limited law enforcement’s ability to chase most nonviolent alleged offenders. The bill has received pushback from much of the law enforcement community, along with some lawmakers who argue the new law prevents cops from doing their jobs effectively. Those who support the law argue it increases safety – for police and civilians alike – due to the inherently dangerous nature of high-speed car chases.\nThe Legislature convenes for its first day Monday. The session is scheduled to last 60 days.",

        "text": "At ‘Climate Cafés,’ mental health experts and environmentalists create a community to tackle climate anxiety\nCHICAGO – Ten years ago, Beth Beyer’s youngest child walked out to Lake Michigan on a mild winter day and cried.\nThe Lincoln Park, Illinois, resident thought her son would be excited about spending time outdoors, but the seventh-grader was distraught thinking about what the unseasonably warm weather meant for the world’s climate.\n“I was like, ‘Wow, you’re taking this in a way that I had no idea,’ ” Beyer remembers saying.\nSince, Beyer’s advocacy and nonprofit work has allowed her to keep her “ear to the ground” and share what she learns from other environmentalists with her two sons to ease their eco-conscious minds. She is the executive director of The Technology Alliance, which makes new technologies available to local underserved communities, and also works with the Chicago Wilderness Alliance.\n“We need to figure out how we channel this anxiety,” she said. “How do we create hope?”\nBeyer recounted this during a Climate Café, one of a few gatherings that Chicago psychotherapist and clinical social worker Libby Bachhuber has helped organize for those struggling with the emotional burdens of climate change: from anxiety, grief, guilt and shame.\nMany mental health professionals agree the most effective way to deal with the difficult feelings brought up by the enormity of the climate crisis might just be to slow down, pay attention to those feelings – as uncomfortable as they may be – and talk through them with other people.\n“Unless we can process our internal responses to climate change, we are not going to be able to respond appropriately to it,” Bachhuber said.\nAfter joining the regional team for the Climate Psychology Alliance North America, Bachhuber trained last year on how to hold small group sessions. She is planning three cafes in the next three months.\nShe organized the recent Climate Café at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum alongside Haven Denson, coordinator for the museum’s Chicago Conservation Corpsprogram, which trains people in grassroots organizing and climate action. Denson said many young people Gen Z peers are mentally checked out when it comes to climate issues.\n“Everybody that I talk to is mostly ready to give up. All we hear is doom and gloom,” Denson said. “We may as well just give up, it’s already too late.”\nAnd the numbers back this up. A study published in the medical journal The Lancet in 2021 found that almost half of Americans surveyed from ages 16 to 25 were very worried or extremely worried about climate change and thought it doomed humanity was doomed because of it.\n“That is why I think this is so important, having these spaces where we can not only talk about solutions, but also just talk about (how) we are in this together, we’re not isolated, it’s OK to feel this way,” Denson said. “To acknowledge these feelings and emotions, to actually process them so that we can then move on and find those solutions.”\nEcological anxiety and grief\n{p class=”krtText”}Some may dismiss eco-anxiety, or fear of environmental catastrophe associated with climate change, as one more term in a long list of “therapy speak” – buzzwords related to psychotherapy and mental health that are often used excessively and incorrectly.\n{p class=”krtText”}But just in the last decade, the number of Americans “alarmed” by climate change has doubled to more than one-third of the population, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n{p class=”krtText”}“People tend to come in and they are worrying a lot,” said Marilee Feldman, founder and clinical director of the Life Counseling Institute in Willowbrook and Park Ridge. She is also the Illinois regional coordinator for the Climate Psychology Alliance North America, which trains psychotherapists to address climate issues and concerns.\n{p class=”krtText”}Feldman said clients often ask themselves: “Where should I live? What is the future? What will it be like for my children?”\n{p class=”krtText”}Another feeling particular to the climate crisis is ecological grief; a great sadness about the loss of nature and species, about a lack of safety and about unfulfilled potential. These and other overwhelming feelings can be exacerbated by a sense of isolation, according to Feldman. “So, that just adds fuel to the fire,” she said.\n{p class=”krtText”}A growing number of climate-aware psychotherapists are hoping to help their patients move past denial and into climate resilience. By accepting reality, people can sort through complex feelings and grow able to tolerate them. Anxiety, grief and despair, anger and rage can all be transformed – by talking with other activists, joining a support group, meeting a climate-aware therapist – into productive action.\n{p class=”krtText”}“I think there’s hope here, in terms of really becoming more adaptive, dealing with all those thoughts, feelings, body sensations,” Feldman said, “to where you take that anxiety, you take that grief and all of that upset, these emotions that are very powerful, and you channel (them) into … your love for this world and making things better and figuring out what’s important to you.”\nGuilt and shame\n{p class=”krtText”}According to The Lancet study, about 42% of young people surveyed in the United States felt guilt and over 44% felt shame in relation to climate change. An associate professor of environmental ethics in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago, Sarah Fredericks said deep shame can cause people to hide or retreat and become paralyzed, unable to act.\n{p class=”krtText”}Guilt and shame in the context of climate change first piqued the ethicist’s curiosity when she lived in Texas a decade or so ago. She owned an old home that she wanted to renovate in an ecologically conscious manner, so she began perusing blogs and websites about eco-friendly design.\n{p class=”krtText”}But Fredericks also found many people online who were plagued by guilt, in response to doing something wrong, and shame, or having negative feelings about one’s whole self. For instance, someone felt bad about driving a minivan around town, someone else was embarrassed to admit they used air conditioning regularly, and yet another person would always forget to bring reusable bags to the grocery store.\n{p class=”krtText”}“It was interesting to me, because people kept using this language that I would think of as very religiously coded language,” Fredericks said. “They would say things like ‘I’m an eco-sinner,’ or ‘I’m a bad person.’ They were judging themselves. And I thought, as a religious studies scholar: Is that what’s going on here? Are these people affiliated with particular religious traditions? Are they not? Where’s this language coming from?”\n{p class=”krtText”}At the time, however, there was basically no existing academic literature documenting this phenomenon; her peers and colleagues told Fredericks it made no sense for people to feel that way as individuals since climate change is a systemic problem.\n{p class=”krtText”}But the more she read and studied discussion boards, websites and books to learn what people were doing about these feelings, Fredericks realized there seemed to be something affirming and validating when people helped others put their guilt and shame into perspective; mistakes were recognized as such and not as an indictment on a person’s morality.\n{p class=”krtText”}“As individuals we exist in communities, and wouldn’t be able to exist without our communities,” Fredericks said. “But a lot of the environmental guilt and shame relate to our community. … There are structures in our community – financial, infrastructural, physical, social – that shape who we are. So we need community responses. And we need community support, the kind of cheerleading or moral support that friends and community and families can offer us.”\nSitting with differences\n{p class=”krtText”}Participants at the recent Climate Café at the nature museum were asked to bring a natural object that illustrates their connection to climate issues.\n{p class=”krtText”}Carolyn Vazquez brought her 10-year-old daughter, Bella.\n{p class=”krtText”}“Well, she’s natural!” she remembers saying with a chuckle. “She’s my object because she’s the future. … What am I leaving her?”\n{p class=”krtText”}For Vazquez, looking out for the environment is a personal and professional endeavor. The Auburn Gresham resident is a community activist and the CEO of hemp manufacturing company Think ReHemption which advocates for sustainable, organic and climate-smart agricultural practices.\n{p class=”krtText”}After the conclusion of their Climate Café and still sitting in a circle, Vazquez and Beyer organically and almost inevitably waded into a conversation about race. Both women, similar in age but with distinct backgrounds, share a passion for the environment and hope to get their communities involved in these issues.\n{p class=”krtText”}Vazquez pointed out that most of her neighbors in Auburn Gresham have basic needs like access to food and concerns like gun violence, matters so urgent they can divert attention from environmental problems.\n{p class=”krtText”}“There are young, African American youth and parents, families who are concerned about it, but you don’t see them,” Vazquez said. “You don’t hear about them. Nor do they feel empowered enough to get a bunch of people who really don’t want to hear that language, who are worried about different stuff.”\n{p class=”krtText”}And because suburban and North Side communities don’t see as much violence, she said, their residents might have more time, energy and resources to direct toward climate advocacy. “The playing ground will never be equal,” Vazquez added.\n{p class=”krtText”}But Beyer herself feels challenged by the fact many people in her Lincoln Park neighborhood don’t feel connected to one another. “Some of us don’t even know what’s going on,” she said. “There’s no forum for it.”\n{p class=”krtText”}“I think these are tough conversations sometimes, and people come from different places. So (with) this small group,” she gestured to the Climate Café participants and facilitators, “I think we’re going real far. … It just helps to get insight.”\n{p class=”krtText”}Bachhuber sat to the side, quietly listening. She finally spoke after a lull in conversation.\n{p class=”krtText”}“It’s challenging, all over in different spaces but including in environmental spaces, to sit with the reality of these differences, how deep they run, and how psychologically they affect us,” she said. “There’s a universality to (climate change), but there’s also a specificity to it, of how different communities are affected. (This conversation) is kind of cool because to me, this is some of the work that needs to happen. … I don’t think this solves with us just being separate and not figuring out how to sit with the discomfort of differences.”\n{p class=”krtText”}Rebecca Weston, co-president of the Climate Psychology Alliance North America, noted that some people may think or suggest climate anxiety is an experience limited to white, middle-class people who are concerned about losing summer homes or getting insurance on their coastal properties. But that’s not true, she argued.\n{p class=”krtText”}“The people who are most worried about climate change are people of color, predominantly women of color,” she said. “The people who are most active around these issues are people of color. The people who are most advocating for policy change are people of color. So to suggest that climate anxiety is just a feeling of the wealthy elite is not correct.”\n{p class=”krtText”}As an activist, Vazquez said she often finds herself “mentally tired and drained” from trying and failing to get people in her neighborhood, which has historically suffered from disinvestment, to pay attention to environmental issues.\n{p class=”krtText”}“I feel like these moments help you connect in a safe space where you feel like you can really talk to people,” she said.\nFrom individualism to community\n{p class=”krtText”}When Ren Dean, the owner of Skunk Cabbage Books, was drawing up a business plan for the Avondale bookstore, one of their main goals was to create a place where folks could talk about their collective futures in the context of climate change. So Dean began a book club for nature-focused writing.\n{p class=”krtText”}“I personally was really feeling like I needed a space, a physical space, to talk to other people and figure out how to find each other and how to support each other,” Dean told the Tribune. “How do we engage with this in a way that isn’t so paralyzing, that feels like there’s something we can do and (there’s) ways we can support each other?”\n{p class=”krtText”}Dean said the group had been reading a lot of good writing about grappling with the immensity of climate anxiety and how community could offer a starting place to begin processing these difficult feelings. But they were also itching to find a space to talk about their mental and emotional experiences instead of just reading about them.\n{p class=”krtText”}“There’s reading that and recognizing that that’s the answer,” Dean said, “and then there’s the next step of: How do I do that? It felt really big and hard for me, personally.”\n{p class=”krtText”}Which is why Dean jumped at an opportunity a few months ago, when Bachhuber reached out with the idea of holding a Climate Café at the bookstore. “It was a really kind of perfect thing for us to host,” Dean said.\n{p class=”krtText”}“We have a very individualistic culture that puts people in a really difficult position as they start to process climate change and learn about it in isolation,” Bachhuber explained. “And our culture of individualism is part of the problem, it’s part of what got us into this situation in the first place.”\n{p class=”krtText”}Talking through their shared feelings and emotions on climate change can help folks untangle themselves from individualistic approaches to the climate crisis, which can oftentimes feel futile and discouraging.\n{p class=”krtText”}“We were raised that way,” Vazquez said. “How do we say, ‘Hey, there’s enough pie for all of us,’ to solve this problem?”",

        "text": 'Warmer winter weather creating headaches for businesses that rely on seasonal tourism\nThe lack of snow and ice in the Midwest is forcing some businesses to delay typical recreational activities, resulting in a loss of tens of thousands of dollars\nThe winter tourism industry in the U.S. typically brings in billions of dollars for the economy, but businesses in many cities across the country are struggling because of record-breaking warm temperatures.\nIn Longville, Minnesota, Tara Mueller drives a mile from shore using the Lake Leech Ice Road. She rented an ice fishing shelter from the Leech Lake Ice Road at Chippewa Lodge with her friend and boyfriend. It’s their first time ice fishing this year.\n"He and I spend most of the winters ice fishing," Mueller said. "This is probably the latest in the season that we’ve actually gotten to go on the ice."\nMike Peterson runs the Leech Lake Ice Road. Though the access point isn’t open for public vehicle traffic yet because of low ice levels, Peterson is still able to rent out one of four, four-person sleeper houses.\n2023 FINISHES AS WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD\n"Our fish houses are a lot lighter than most of the manufactured ones nowadays. So, we\'re able to get them on a little bit thinner ice than normal," Peterson said. "This time of year should be a heck of a lot more busy than it is."\nLast year, 400 to 500 people used the ice road over New Year’s weekend. This year? Zero.\nChippewa Lodge Owner Josh May said it’s a loss of tens of thousands of dollars for their business. With less anglers on the lake, most businesses that survive on tourism have been severely impacted.\n"It’s not just us that are suffering, it’s the grocery stores, it’s the liquor stores, the bars, restaurants," May said of businesses in Longville, which has a population of less than 200.\nA few hours north on the U.S.-Canadian border, Gunflint Lodge was finally able to open skating up to the public last week, but their cross-country skiing and snowmobile trails are still closed for visitors because there isn’t enough snow.\n‘SELFLESS’ MINNESOTA DEPUTY CRAWLS ACROSS THIN ICE TO RESCUE FISHERMEN, DOG: VIDEO\nGuests can take a horse-drawn carriage around the property, but the Clydesdale horses sit waiting for more wintry weather. The sleigh needs about two feet of snow to make it through the mountainous terrain.\nOwners John and Mindy Frederickson said they are hoping for more snow as soon as possible, but they’re adapting.\n"The resorts up here are pivoting from cross country skiing and snowmobiling and focusing on skating and clearing paths on the ice for skating and kind of using what we do have," John said. "The families are really resilient and will adjust to whatever we got."\nBecause of warmer temperatures, vacationers have been able to hit the hiking trails – something they have not been able to do during this time of year in the past.\n"I\'m sure that there\'s some people that are being a little bit more cautious and you know, don\'t want to plan their snowmobile trip or their ski trip until they know that there\'s snow, but you know, it\'ll come. There\'s never been a [year] where it hasn\'t snowed," Mindy said.\nThis week, the historic John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon in Minnesota was canceled for 2024 by organizers due to a lack of snow cover. Other tournaments and competitions involving snow or ice-related activities have been postponed across the country because of higher temperatures.\nDr. Stefan Liess, a researcher at the Department of Soil, Water and Climate at the University of Minnesota, said climate change and a powerful El Niño weather pattern this year are to blame for the warmer winter temperatures in the U.S, but even without El Niño, the planet is warming – which he described as a global phenomenon.\nBIDEN SAYS COP28 REACHED ‘HISTORIC MILESTONE’ AFTER AL GORE DEEMS NEGOTIATIONS ON VERGE OF ‘COMPLETE FAILURE’\n"We rely on tourism also and tourism relies on snow cover," Liess said. "We still expect to have snow on the ground, so skiing will not easily go away in Minnesota. It will be just a shorter period of time where [it] might be available."\nScientists can produce physical models that show snow cover based on greenhouse gas concentrations. Liess said some models show that we could see half of the amount of snow in 100 years because of climate change.\n"One of the biggest uncertainties is actually our human behavior. How much more of those gases will be put into the air and that depends on also how the snow cover will look like," Liess said.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nBecause of the lack of snow, it’s common for many ski resorts to use artificial snow, which Liess described as a short-term solution that can be more harmful to the planet.',

Then it more than doubled to $194 million in 2021.\nTo drive even more interest in new releases, the company adopted a system around \"drops\" that’s often seen in sneaker culture and used by streetwear brands, according to Retail Dive.\nBEER-DRINKING IN AMERICA FELL TO LOWEST POINT THIS CENTURY AMID BUD LIGHT BOYCOTT: 'TOUGH YEAR FOR BEER'\nThe limited drops generate attention from fans and often cause products to sell out quickly, just like the most recent one happening in Target stores.\n\"I think there certainly is a promotional strategy around FOMO, fear of missing out, culture and really driving really intense demand for products by offering limited, special-edition drops; partnerships with other really cool, hot, trendy brands; collaborations with celebrities and artists and athletes — has really just helped create the brand status I would say we have today,\" Navarro told Retail Dive.\n|Ticker\n|Security\n|Last\n|Change\n|Change %\n|SBUX\n|STARBUCKS CORP.\n|92.99\n|-0.56\n|-0.60%\nThe Quencher skyrocketed Stanley’s sales by appealing to a demographic that Stanley had not previously spent too much time catering to in its first hundred years: women.\nThe brand had long been marketed to men and especially outdoorsmen, but with the help of a group of influencers, the company unlocked the power of women selling to women, according to Retaildive.com.\nNEW YEAR'S EVE BEVERAGE COULD GO EXTINCT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AI COMPANY PREDICTS\nMatt Navarro, senior vice president of global commerce at Stanley, told Retail Dive that affiliate marketing channel has opened Stanley up to new audiences and has allowed consumers to connect more directly with the brand.\n\"Frankly, the consumer sort of took over for us in places like TikTok where we have 700 million views of #StanleyTumbler on TikTok,\" Navarro told Retail Dive. \"All of the videos and content on TikTok are user-generated. So it’s really the consumer connecting to our brand through social media, and just putting the consumer first.\"\nNavarro added that the company was fortunate to have a 110-year-old brand rooted in American history.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\"So many people, especially in the U.S. and North America, have an emotional connection to our brand — from their grandfather taking them fishing with Stanley [products] to working on a job site. Just a deep, emotional connection with our brand, which allowed us to then — through innovation and really through our digital marketing expertise — bring the brand to the 21st century and connect with today’s consumer.\"\nIn 2023, Stanley saw a 275% year-over-year increase in Quencher sales and has experienced a 215% increase in its best-selling category, hydration, according to Navarro.",

        "text": "We have an active winter weather pattern starting to come together. It could include some snow—enough to stick modestly commencing in the early hours of Saturday morning and continuing lightly into the day. It’s the product of precip and cloudiness beneath the far northern flank of a storm system which is to move from New Mexico eastward through the Gulf States then turn northeastward and potentially turn into a big snow producer from the interior Mid-Atlantic north into New England.\nThat’s an area which, like Chicago, has seen a lackluster winter snow season—so it’s a system sure to generate notice and some headlines there. Boston may be among the areas hit with significant snow.\nTHAT SYSTEM will spread clouds into the Chicago area Friday and Friday night and light snows on its far north side could accumulate—perhaps laying down a half inch to an inch and a half Saturday. A moistening air mass means the snow could mix with some drizzle as the day warms on Saturday. Clouds in the wake of that system are to linger Sunday with some flurries or a bit of drizzle at times.\nThings rev up with a more powerful storm system that approaches Monday and appears likely to be producing wet snow Monday night into Tuesday and Tuesday night in an increasingly windy environment. The storm is to generate cold air and is likely to produce snow of some substance. But dew points creep toward or just above freezing Tuesday in at least parts of the area on current model guidance. This suggests VERY WET snow and also the chance parts of the metro area could see a mix of precip.\nTHE STORM SYSTEM is still days away and forecast features with it will be refined as fresher data comes in.\nThe hemispheric change suggests a colder pattern is ahead beginning the back half of next week into mid-January\nNature appears about ready to introduce a “chink in El Niño’s armor”. The abnormally mild temps which have led to the lack of snow and radically reduced Great Lakes ice coverage among other weather features, have been influenced by a strong El Niño in the equatorial Pacific superimposed on a planet that is undergoing warming as a part of climate change.\nBut, when it comes to cold season weather, other developments can dampen El Niño’s warming influence—and modeling suggests we may see such a change coming together.\nWarming aloft at high latitudes—over regions including Greenland and a swath of northern Canada in the coming weeks—is leading to the development of a “GREENLAND BLOCKING PATTERN”.\nForecast models are indicating a GREENLAND BLOCK appears in the northern hemisphere’s future if the current computer model forecast over the coming 2 weeks is verified.\nGreenland Blocks often serve as “COLD SIGNALS” for the Midwest. The development of vast warm pools aloft over Greenland and sections of northern Canada there often produces shifts in jet stream steering winds which send colder air sweeping south into the Midwest and often the eastern two-thirds of the Lower 48.\nJet streams over North America grow “wavy”—reaching high into the Arctic then diving southward into the Lower 48 with cold air in tow. That’s what models—including the Weather Service’s “GEFS” model show happening in the coming weeks. This could produce Winter 2022-23’s first break in the prolonged milder than normal temps.\nThe question becomes—once in place, will the colder pattern last?—or is it to merely be an “interruption” to the mild, snow-less pattern that has dominated this cold season to date driven in large part by El Niño? That will be interesting to monitor.\nGreat Lakes’ total ice cover as of the January 3, 2024 analysis is only 0.3%.\nUnseasonably mild weather and the lack of prolonged cold spells and sustained low temps have impeded the formation and maintenance of significant ice coverage. The analysis below shows the water temperatures in blue and green, and the ice concentration in black and gray:\nHere’s an interesting analysis, not only on the lack of Great Lakes ice but also on the lackluster natural snowpack at several U.S. ski resorts. The piece is written by highly regarded environment reporter Axios’ Andrew Freedman: https://www.axios.com/2024/01/04/winter-ski-resorts-snow…\nA “cold signal” for the Midwest\nFORECAST OF THE ARCTIC OSCILLATION (AO) off the European Centre’s ensemble model. This is a “COLD SIGNAL” for Chicago and the Midwest and has implications on the weather pattern over the eastern two-thirds of the Lower 48.\nThe PREDICTED NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION is predicted to dip into its NEGATIVE PHASE.",

        "text": "Support local news coverage and the people who report it by subscribing to the Napa Valley Register.\nSen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, currently holds the 3rd District seat, but will be termed out from the Senate after 2024. The district includes Napa, Solano and Yolo counties and parts of Sacramento, Sonoma and Contra Costa counties.\nPedroza said it would be a privilege to contribute to making a difference on a larger scale.\n“This is a moment in time where we need leaders to really do their jobs and achieve outcomes to make people’s lives better,” Pedroza said.\nPedroza added that he wants to make a difference for housing and the homeless, and to inspire a transition from talk to action on climate change.\nAs a Napa County supervisor, Pedroza doesn't have the chance to become well known in such 3rd District population centers as Fairfield-Suisun City and Davis. Yet he pointed out that his work extends beyond his own county.\nHe is chairperson of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. That has him involved in regional transportation issues, such as Interstate 80 improvements, express lanes and a mega-regional partnership, he said.\nMTC has provided him an opportunity to know what the needs are in other areas. He’d be ready from day one as a senator, because he knows the district, knows the issues and has built relationships, Pedroza said.\nPedroza is a Napa County native. He was assistant vice president at a local Mechanics Bank and in 2012, at age 25, became the youngest person and first Latino to be elected to the Napa City Council.\nIn December 2014, then-Gov. Jerry Brown appointed Pedroza to fill the Napa County Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Dodd when Dodd was elected to the state Assembly. Pedroza won election in 2016 and 2020; his current term ends in 2024.\nPedroza in 2022 drew criticism in some quarters for a late 2021 vote he cast on the Walt Ranch vineyard project. Citizens discovered Pedroza’s family had bought land next to Walt Ranch and brought the issue to the state Fair Political Practices Commission. A year later, the FPPC has yet to announce results of a conflict-of-interest investigation.\nCritics earlier this year tried and failed to gather enough signatures to qualify a recall against Pedroza for the ballot. Still, recall proponent Beth Nelsen said afterward that the effort would halt Pedroza from progressing in his political career.\nWhen asked about the recall attempt, Pedroza talked about learning to be a better representative and leader. He's prepared to work with the people who tried to recall him, he said.\n“Those moments don’t determine whether we work together in the future. We have to continue to work together,” Pedroza said.\nPHOTOS: Astronaut Dr. Kate Rubins speaks at her alma mater Vintage High",
