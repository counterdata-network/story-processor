    "story_text": "Massachusetts communities hit hardest by coronavirus now lag far behind in vaccinations Herd immunity is within reach in much of Massachusetts, but state data shows vaccinations are lagging far behind in many of the communities that bore the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 fueling fears they could be left vulnerable to yet another blow from the deadly disease. \u201cThere is a concern we could have focal outbreaks in these places,\u201d said Dr. Davidson Hamer, a Boston University infectious disease specialist. \u201cIt poses a risk to the broader community and herd immunity.\u201d. Statewide, 59% of all people have received at least one coronavirus shot, according to state health data. Among eligible adults, the vaccination rate climbs to 79%. That\u2019s starting to come close to the range experts have said could create herd immunity, which is when enough people are immune so that the spread begins to halt. But in many of the 20 communities identified by the state as the hardest hit by coronavirus cases, vaccination rates are much lower. . Fewer than half of all Springfield, Lawrence, Holyoke, Fitchburg, Fall River and Brockton residents had received their first coronavirus shot as of Thursday. A little over half of all residents in Haverhill, Lowell, Lynn, Methuen and Worcester had gotten at least one shot. Vaccination rates in Chelsea, Everett, Boston, Leominster, Malden, Randolph, Framingham and Revere are in the 60% range. Hamer said the data points to \u201cobvious vaccine access and equity issues\u201d in cities and towns with large communities of color and larger populations of lower socioeconomic status. The administration of Gov. Charlie Baker has funneled $30 million into outreach efforts like door-to-door canvassing, flyer drops and community-based vaccination clinics \u201cto address vaccine equity and access for the commonwealth\u2019s most disproportionately impacted communities,\u201d a state COVID-19 command center spokeswoman said. . \u201cThese targeted initiatives are working, and it shows; for the last two weeks, none of the commonwealth\u2019s equity communities were identified as high risk, and this week, for the first time since August 2020, there are no high-risk communities,\u201d she said. It\u2019s true in Chelsea, where Chelsea City Manager Thomas Ambrosino said the efforts are \u201creally driving people to vaccination sites.\u201d There, 67% of residents have already gotten their first shot. But other community leaders \u2014 while grateful for the state cash \u2014 point to slow progress in breaking down barriers fueling vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Rick Herman, Brockton\u2019s COVID-19 consultant, said mobile clinics in Brockton \u2014 where just 49% of residents have gotten a shot \u2014 haven\u2019t been as successful as hoped. \u201cPeople right now are using their creativity and trying whatever they can to get people to come out and get vaccinated. Some works \u2014 next year we will have a pretty good idea of what worked, but now we\u2019re just trying everything,\u201d Herman said. State Sen. Adam Gomez, D-Springfield, said infiltrating hesitancy in Black and Brown communities has proved challenging. Just 43% of Springfield residents have received a shot. \u201cWe just need to make sure vaccines are readily available,\u201d Gomez said. Phil Geoffroy, assistant to Lowell\u2019s city manager, agreed \u201cconvenience\u201d is proving key. In state Sen. Diana DiZoglio\u2019s hometown of Methuen, 54% of residents had received one shot as of the latest data. DiZoglio, a Democrat, criticized the Baker administration\u2019s push to shutter the remaining mass vaccination sites over the next month. \u201cShutting down vaccine sites at a time when nearly half the population in many cities and towns have yet to receive a single dose makes little sense. We know there is vaccine hesitancy and these sites should remain open to make more folks feel comfortable,\u201d DiZoglio said. Baker has refocused resources to pop-up and mobile vaccination clinics in an effort to meet people in the communities where they live, he has said. . .",
