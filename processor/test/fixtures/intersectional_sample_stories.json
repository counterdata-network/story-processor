  "\nAn internal panel at the Phoenix Police Department has ruled that the fatal shooting of a mentally ill woman last year by an officer fell outside of department policy.\n\nThe decision comes more than a year after the August 2014 death of 50-year-old Michelle Cusseaux, a woman shot while police were trying to serve a mental-health pickup.\n\nSgt. Percy Dupra fired at Cusseaux after police said she opened her door with a claw hammer raised above her head.\n\nAccording to Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump, the recommendation by the department’s Use of Force Board was approved by Chief Joe Yahner and will now be forwarded to the department’s Disciplinary Review Board.\n\nThat board will make a discipline recommendation for Dupra that could include  suspension, demotion or termination.\n\nActivists mark 1 year after Phoenix woman killed by police\n\nCusseaux’s death has sparked several  bouts of community outcry in the year since, with critics challenging both the department’s use-of-force policies and training to deal with mentally ill individuals.\n",
  "Vehicle plows into New Year's crowd in Tokyo, injures eight people TOKYO (Reuters) - At least eight people were injured, one seriously, when a vehicle plowed into crowds celebrating New Year’s Day in Tokyo early on Tuesday. A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said. NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident as an “act of terror” but later said the attack was in retaliation for capital punishment. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. “I can’t believe it, this is a place I’m familiar with, so it’s very shocking,” said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area. The street was closed to vehicles at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrians making their way to the shrine for New Year’s prayers. TV pictures of the scene on Tuesday showed a gray colored light vehicle used in the attack, positioned across the street. The front of the vehicle was badly damaged and dozens of police and rescue officials were at the scene. The suspect fled from the scene and assaulted a passerby before he was captured 20 minutes later, NHK said. About 20 liters of kerosene were found in the vehicle. “I learned about the incident later. But I shudder to think. If the incident had happened five minutes later, I would’ve been involved,” a woman who walked past the scene shortly after the incident told NHK. In a similar attack in 2008, a man who said he was tired of life drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Tokyo before jumping out and stabbing several people. At least seven people were killed and a dozen injured. Reporting by Kwiyeon Ha, Kim Kyung-Hoon; Writing by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Neil Fullick. . . . .\n",

On June 1, Houston Police said a body found in a motel in Jasper was believed to be the 5-year-old boy and Theresa Balboa, Dalton Olson\\'s girlfriend, had been taken into custody.\\nCourt documents now state that Samuel might have died as far back as May 10, and that Balboa had left the child\\'s body in a bathtub for two days before moving him to different locations in a plastic storage box.\\nWhen Dalton Olson reported his son missing, he told police Balboa had been looking after Samuel since April 30—which was also the last day he was seen in school.\\nThe investigation began to focus on Balboa after she falsely claimed that Samuel\\'s mother, Sarah Olson, and a man dressed as a police officer had taken him from her home at around 7:30 a.m. on May 27. Sarah Olson later provided the authorities with surveillance footage to prove this did not happen, reported ABC 13.\\nOn May 28, detectives interviewed Balboa\\'s roommate at the apartment where Samuel had been staying with her. The roommate said Balboa had called him on or around May 10 and told him Samuel was dead.\\nAn affidavit states that the roommate returned home and saw Samuel\\'s bruised body on a bed. The roommate said he and Balboa then placed Samuel\\'s body in a bathtub \"where he remained for two days,\" reported Fox 7.\\nThe roommate said he bought duct tape and a plastic bin at Walmart on May 13.

  "A Fort Worth police officer shot and killed a woman inside her own home early Saturday morning, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. Just before 2:30 a.m., police responded to a welfare call in the Hillside Morningside neighborhood, where the front door to a residence was reported open.\n\n\nWhen officers arrived, they searched the perimeter of the house and saw a person standing inside the residence, near a window.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday afternoon, the Fort Worth Police Department said an officer perceived a threat then drew his weapon. He fired one shot, striking and killing 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson.\n\nThe officer — a white male who has been with FWPD since April 2018 — has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. His name has not been released.\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price released a statement she said was \"tragic\" to write. \"A young woman has lost her life, leaving her family in unbelievable grief. All of Fort Worth must surround Atatiana Jefferson's family with prayers, love and support,\" Price said.\n\nPrice promised a \"complete and thorough investigation\" to be conducted by Police Chief Ed Kraus, which will then be forwarded to the Tarrant County District Attorney Law Enforcement Incident Team.\n",
  "LOVELAND, Colo. (KDVR) — The civil rights attorney for a 19-year-old man shot three times by a Loveland Police officer Monday night said he is developmentally delayed and was suffering a mental health crisis.\n\nThe officer responded to a disturbance at 1620 Tennessee St. just before 7 p.m. Alexander Domina was in his backyard with a knife in hand, police said. The Domina family attorney, Mari Newman, said the officer shot Domina in the abdomen three times.\n\n“Alex’s grandmother called 911 because he was having a mental health crisis. She was very clear to the 911 dispatcher that he had not hurt anybody, that he could be talked down,” Newman said. “And then when the officer came, she repeated that it’s a mental health crisis, he can be talked down, and yet a Loveland officer came in, guns ablazing, and shot this young man three times.”\n\nNewman said Domina’s grandmother is raising him because he was severely abused during his childhood and has serious developmental delays as a result. She said he has an IQ of about 62.\n\n“My goodness, that is something no family member should ever have, where we can’t call 911 without the fear that something horrifying might happen just like this,” Newman said. “Instead of serving and protecting, will actually be the ones that ultimately shoot and maybe even kill an innocent young man.”\n\nNewman said Domina’s grandmother called 911 to protect herself and him and told police he had not harmed anyone.\n\n“There is absolutely no legal, no moral, no human justification for shooting this innocent young man. He was very clearly in the throes of a mental health crisis,” Newman said. “His grandmother had said time and time again that he could be talked down, but instead of doing what needed to be done, Loveland Police officers did the same thing they did just a few months ago.”\n\nThe Loveland Police Department has been under scrutiny following the use-of-force in the arrest of a 73-year-old woman with dementia. The officers involved in that case were fired and charged.\n\n“Unfortunately, instead of treating this family with compassion, the Loveland Police officer who shot Alex wouldn’t provide him with any medical care, wouldn’t even let his grandmother go over and hold his hand as he was crying out, as he was probably dying,” Newman said.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, Domina was listed in serious condition at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland. Newman said his condition was dire."
