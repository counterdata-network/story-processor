    "story_text": "From Bend It Like Beckham to Diego Maradona: the best films about football Bend It Like Beckham 2002. Gurinder Chadha\u2019s feelgood comedy was really the first film to get the hang of how to show football action on screen with loose-limbed energy and fun. Keira Knightley made her breakthrough as the up-and-coming footballing talent Jules. She befriends Jess, played by Parminder Nagra, whose dad is far from happy about her playing football. . Offside 2006. Jafar Panahi\u2019s comedy is about female football fans desperate to defy Iran\u2019s no-women rule and sneak in to the Iran v Bahrain qualifier for the 2006 World Cup \u2013 disguised as men. They find themselves grabbed by the police and herded into a special holding pen, being watched over by a miserable cop who is to suffer a karmic punishment for his sexism. Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait 2006. Artists and film-makers Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno had the nifty idea of filming Real Madrid v Villarreal in 2005 and keeping the camera close up on Zin\u00e9dine Zidane for the entirety of the match. In real time, we watch the hypnotic spectacle of Zidane\u2019s great Easter Island statue face filling the screen. War-zonal marking . Bobby Moore, Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone in Escape to Victory. Photograph: Lorimar Film Entertainment/Allstar Escape to Victory 1981. John Huston\u2019s all-movie-star, all-football-star drama about a second world war PoW camp in which allied soldiers form a team to play an \u201cexhibition match\u201d against the Germans. Michael Caine plays the coach, with Sylvester Stallone as the US soldier who serves as his trainer. Pele, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardiles also star. Looking for Eric 2009. Some might say that Ken Loach\u2019s greatest football film is Kes, with Brian Glover as the bumptious PE teacher. But this film had a role for one of the finest examples of a professional player going on to a movie career: the superlative Eric Cantona, playing himself in a vision to a depressed Manchester United supporter. Leeds much to be desired . Michael Sheen as Brian Clough in The Damned United. Photograph: Sony/Everett/Rex The Damned United 2009. Tom Hooper\u2019s film version of David Peace\u2019s novel about Brian Clough and his ill-fated stint managing Leeds United in 1974, with Michael Sheen giving us a classic turn as the great man. Did Clough want to destroy \u201cDirty Leeds\u201d or did he want to destroy himself, ashamed of having taken Leeds\u2019 shilling?. Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football 2018. The Brazilian fantasist and conman Carlos \u201cKaiser\u201d Raposo was given a trial in the 1980s by the Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto and used that one brush with greatness to get briefly signed for a string of Brazilian clubs. But he never actually played football for anyone, becoming a mascot kept around for his party-animal attitude. Handyman . Diego Maradona. Photograph: Lifestyle Pictures/Alamy Diego Maradona 2019. Asif Kapadia\u2019s documentary about footballing great Diego Maradona tells his gripping story purely through TV footage, masterfully chosen and shaped. Maradona causes mass hysteria in Buenos Aires and Naples: goals, nightclubs, goals, gangsters, girlfriends, pregnancies, pregnancy denials, cocaine, weight gain, despair \u2026 it\u2019s like a 130-minute Match of the Day title sequence by Sophocles. Mike Bassett: England Manager 2001. Steve Barron\u2019s mockumentary is about the beleaguered but lovable national boss Mike Bassett (Ricky Tomlinson). Switching between gloomy stoicism and impotent rage, Bassett clearly has something of Graham Taylor while also capable of unleashing a blistering half-time team talk with the passion of Alex Ferguson. The Arsenal Stadium Mystery 1939. Thorold Dickinson is a British director admired by Scorsese \u2013 and here is his football mystery thriller, one of the first to feature football, an Agatha-Christie-ish caper set in Arsenal\u2019s old Highbury ground and featuring real players. Arsenal are playing the fictitious amateur side the Trojans, one of whom drops dead and everyone\u2019s a suspect. . .",
