    "story_text": "Man at Country Club Thought Bug Bit Him, Was Actually Hit by Stray Bullet An investigation has been launched after a North Carolina man, who thought he was bitten by a bug while on a country club patio, was actually struck by a stray bullet. The Guilford County Sheriff's Office said that the 57-year-old male was dining outside at the Sedgefield Country Club at around 6:53 p.m. on Tuesday, June 8, when he was struck by the bullet. The man only received superficial wounds to the top of the head and declined to go to the hospital for treatment. Spokesperson Lori Poag told The McClatchy News the bullet caused some bleeding after it \"grazed the outermost layer of his scalp.\". The impact of the bullet was so minor, the man actually thought that what he felt was a bug biting him. It was only when officers arrived at the scene and found a bullet on the ground that he realized what had hit him. \"Preliminary investigations by the Sheriff's Office have determined the victim was not targeted and it appears the shooting was accidental at this time (possibly from a bullet fired into the air from some distance away), but the investigation continues,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Poag said officers believe the bullet came from a gun that could have been fired up to a mile away. \"No one that was out on the patio eating with him remembered hearing a sound of a gun being shot,\" she told The McClatchy News. . Deputies patrolled the area after responding to the man and could not find anyone firing a gun, nor could they hear any more gunshots. Anyone with information concerning this incident is encouraged to contact the Sheriff's District 3 Office at 336-641-6691. The Guilford County Sheriff's Office has been contacted for an update. The same day, a 15-year-old girl was seriously injured after she was struck by a stray bullet in Kingsburg, California. The teenager suffered a punctured lung after she was hit by the bullet just before 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 8, while playing soccer at Athwal Park. Witnesses reported hearing several shots in the southwest area of Kingsburg. The 15-year-old was able to call her father, who responded a few minutes later and called 911. The Kingsburg Police Department said it appears multiple random shots were fired into the air and one of the descending projectiles struck the girl as she was playing in the park. \"With the Independence Day holiday approaching, this is a good reminder of how dangerous and unlawful it is to randomly shoot a firearm into the air. Remember, what goes up, must come down,\" Kingsburg Police said in a statement. \"The public is encouraged to contact law enforcement whenever they hear gunshots.\".
