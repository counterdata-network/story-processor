    "story_text": "The unanswered 'Jeopardy!' question: Who's the new host? LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cJeopardy!\u201d needed a host, and Lucille Ball had an enthusiastic suggestion for creator Merv Griffin: The smooth-voiced, debonair emcee of the \u201cHigh Rollers\u201d game show. That was 1984. Decades later, filling the void left by the late Alex Trebek involves sophisticated research and a parade of guest hosts doing their best to impress viewers and the studio that's expected to make the call before the new season begins taping later this summer. Think of Sony Pictures Television as clutching the rose, and Mayim Bialik, Anderson Cooper, Katie Couric and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champs Ken Jennings and Buzzy Cohen among the suitors so far, with more to come including Robin Roberts, Dr. Sanjay Gupta and LeVar Burton. Sony has \u201cthe most robust team of people I have ever seen looking at this and analyzing it in a very cerebral way,\u201d said executive producer Mike Richards. \u201cIt\u2019s a real change from the way casting has traditionally been done on television.\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s usually been a gut instinct of the head executive: \u2018How about that person?\u2019\u201d Richards said. That was producer-entertainer Griffin\u2019s approach when he brought a syndicated version of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d to TV, five years after the quiz show\u2019s last network iteration wrapped in 1979 on NBC. A word from Ball, of \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d fame, and Trebek\u2019s skill and experience sealed his hire. Audience and critical regard for the Canadian-born Trebek grew over the years, which makes finding a worthy replacement both a gesture of respect for the late host and the means to protect a corporate asset. While ratings have shifted under the guest hosts, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d remains among the top-ranked syndicated programs in viewership. Trebek helped build the show\u2019s \u201cdisplay of excellence with his own excellence. And it\u2019s tremendously difficult to find somebody to replace him, not only because of the status that he had in the American imagination,\u201d said Deepak Sarma, a Case Western Reserve University professor and Netflix cultural consultant. \u201cAnyone who is going to take his position will be judged in the end against this model of perfection.\u201d. Game show hosts of Trebek\u2019s era were usually radio and TV broadcasting veterans steeped in the genre, and almost invariably white men. Among the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d subs are men and women of color and prospects from a variety of fields, including NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The approach makes sense to Louis Virtel, a longtime fan whose vantage point is informed by writing for a game show (\u201cMatch Game\u201d) and competing on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see all these different fill-ins. I\u2019m open to suggestions, and I think most people are,\u201d said Virtel, a \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d writer and co-host of the \u201cKeep It\u201d podcast. \u201c\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 is a one-of-a-kind show, and the replacement should be tailored to the game.\u201d. What makes for a good \u201cJeopardy!\u201d host?. \u201cI think establishing a sense of comfort (so) the audience just eases into the game,\u201d Virtel said. \u201cAlso a sense of stakes, that a real tough game is being played. It\u2019s called \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 for a reason. The host is there to make sure we\u2019re all on our toes.\u201d. The try-outs are an unusually public form of auditioning, one that could cause flop sweat even for veteran emcees. For actor Bialik of \u201cBlossom,\u201d \"The Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cCall Me Kat,\u201d any nerves were crowded out by the demands of the job \u2014 and she's a neuroscientist. \u201cThere is very little room for not being 100% dialed in to the job of hosting when you are on that stage,\u201d Bialik said in an email. It proved the most \"joyful, challenging, transcendent act I have undertaken \u2014 second only to giving birth to my second son on the floor of my living room.\u201d. Back in the day, there were only a handful of pioneers like Betty White, the first female game show host to win a Daytime Emmy (for 1983's \u201cJust Men!\u201d), and Adam Wade, a Black singer who hosted the 1975 game show \u201cMusical Chairs.\u201d Wayne Brady, Steve Harvey and Meredith Vieira are among those who made further inroads, with pressure only growing on the entertainment industry to reflect America more broadly on screen. But taking over for an authority figure like Trebek is harder on women and others not typically seen in such roles, said Sarma. \"The sorts of expectations placed on a person of color in a leadership position are usually higher than those placed on a white person in position of power,\" he said, and any error or \u201cslight movement against the norm is jumped upon . as some tremendous mistake.\u201d. There could be backlash from those resentful that Trebek isn't replaced like-for-like, which Sarma said isn't far-fetched in this period of social discord. \u201cSony is in a pickle,\u201d he said. Series producer Richards, the second temporary host after Trebek's pancreatic cancer death last November at age 80, holds an optimistic view despite the prospect of online trolls and whatever their gripes about the newbie may be. \u201cMy hope is that whoever is chosen will be given a chance to prove why they were chosen, without too much static,\" he said. \u201cUltimately, we are trying to put out the best product for our fans. That tends to narrow your focus to a pretty nice North Star, as opposed to, \u2018What\u2019s the internet going to say?'\u201d. . .",
