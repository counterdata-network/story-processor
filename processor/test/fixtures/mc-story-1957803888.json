    "story_text": "Man jailed at George Bailey in Otay Mesa dies, sheriff's officials say A 41-year-old Riverside County man jailed since his January arrest in Carlsbad died Wednesday at the George F. Bailey Detention Center in Otay Mesa, sheriff\u2019s officials said. Jerry Aleman, of Perris, was found unresponsive in his cell around 5 p.m. and died at the county jail despite resuscitation efforts by deputies, medical staff and later firefighters, sheriff\u2019s Lt. Thomas Seiver said. The county Medical Examiner\u2019s Office conducted an autopsy Thursday, but the cause and manner of Aleman\u2019s death had not yet been determined, Seiver said in a news release. The autopsy resulted in a presumptive positive test for fentanyl, though \u201cfurther laboratory testing is required to confirm\u201d the suspected drug use, Seiver said. Thursday\u2019s disclosure of Aleman\u2019s death followed a pledge made by sheriff\u2019s officials in April to announce jail deaths within 24 hours . In recent years, department officials had waited months to disclose in-custody deaths until complete autopsy results and internal Sheriff\u2019s Department investigations were finalized. Deaths have plagued San Diego County\u2019s jails for more than a decade, according to a six-month investigation published by the Union-Tribune in 2019, which found San Diego County had the highest jail-mortality rate among California\u2019s largest counties . Overall, more than 150 men and women have died in Sheriff\u2019s Department custody since 2009, records show. Sheriff\u2019s homicide detectives are investigating Aleman\u2019s death, as is typical for all in-custody deaths regardless of whether they are suspicious in nature. Carlsbad police arrested Aleman Jan. 18, and Seiver said he\u2019d been jailed since then on suspicion of more than two dozen crimes, including 18 counts of various identity theft accusations, as well as forgery, fraud and other related charges. . .",
