  "Vehicle plows into New Year's crowd in Tokyo, injures eight people TOKYO (Reuters) - At least eight people were injured, one seriously, when a vehicle plowed into crowds celebrating New Year’s Day in Tokyo early on Tuesday. A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said. NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident as an “act of terror” but later said the attack was in retaliation for capital punishment. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. “I can’t believe it, this is a place I’m familiar with, so it’s very shocking,” said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area. The street was closed to vehicles at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrians making their way to the shrine for New Year’s prayers. TV pictures of the scene on Tuesday showed a gray colored light vehicle used in the attack, positioned across the street. The front of the vehicle was badly damaged and dozens of police and rescue officials were at the scene. The suspect fled from the scene and assaulted a passerby before he was captured 20 minutes later, NHK said. About 20 liters of kerosene were found in the vehicle. “I learned about the incident later. But I shudder to think. If the incident had happened five minutes later, I would’ve been involved,” a woman who walked past the scene shortly after the incident told NHK. In a similar attack in 2008, a man who said he was tired of life drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Tokyo before jumping out and stabbing several people. At least seven people were killed and a dozen injured. Reporting by Kwiyeon Ha, Kim Kyung-Hoon; Writing by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Neil Fullick. . . . .\n",

  "'$750,000 bail set in man\\'s slaying A Jefferson County man remains in the county jail in lieu of $750,000 bond, and woman identified as his girlfriend is still behind bars in lieu of $50,000 bond for charges related to a June 5 shooting of a Mabelvale man. Bradley Scott Hartley, 34, is charged with first-degree murder of Zakary Chumney, 35, and possession of firearms by certain persons. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to five felony offenses related to a 2013 burglary and served 24 months in prison. Opal Evelyn King, 20, is accused of aggravated assault and hindering apprehension or prosecution. Investigators say King was upset and rammed Chumney\\'s vehicle several times during a related confrontation and then lied about Hartley\\'s identity because she did not want him to get into trouble. The bail bonds, which are secured, were set during probable cause hearings in Jefferson County District Court earlier this week. A lawyer has not been listed for either suspect in court records. According to an affidavit from Jefferson County sheriff\\'s investigator Terry W. Wingard, deputies were responding to a disturbance at Lee Springs and Sullivan roads about 8 a.m. June 5 when they were advised of a shooting at 10256 Sulphur Springs Road. A deputy reportedly found an unresponsive male, identified as Chumney, lying on the ground and performed CPR on him until medical personnel arrived. Chumney died at Jefferson Regional Medical Center at 8:15 a.m. from a gunshot wound in the chest. The deputy, Wingard wrote, was told the shooter fled on foot to a wooded area. Upon asking King and another woman, Chi Ann Holland, the deputy was given the name of the suspect, Hartley, whom Holland reportedly identified as King\\'s boyfriend. She reportedly gave the deputy a clothing description, a direction of where Hartley allegedly fled and said Hartley was armed with a silver revolver. King allegedly told authorities her boyfriend\\'s name was Devon Nash, according to the affidavit. Wingard wrote that investigators learned that the disturbance, which the sheriff\\'s office said involved white and green SUVs, was connected to the shooting. The white SUV, a 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe, and green SUV, a GMC Yukon, reportedly sustained bumper damage and were seized. Chumney reportedly drove the Yukon, in which an investigator found an unloaded black and silver Taurus 9mm pistol in the glove box. About 11:40 a.m., Wingard wrote, Hartley spoke to sheriff\\'s officials by phone and agreed to turn himself in. Unarmed, Hartley was taken back to the Sulphur Springs residence and read his Miranda rights. He was then asked to locate a gun and directed investigators to a wooded area, where a silver RG revolver was found. Holland reportedly told King she had purchased the Tahoe from Chumney and persuaded King to take her to where she allegedly hid the vehicle, which investigators say is Sullivan Road. An argument involving Chumney, King and Hartley was said to have ensued when the three returned to the Sulphur Springs residence, and Holland reportedly told investigators that Hartley shot Chumney once the victim approached Hartley, according to the affidavit. King was taken into custody and told investigators Chumney was \"hollering and screaming, calling Bradley\" an offensive name, according to the affidavit. She reportedly added that Chumney walked up to Hartley with his shirt raised and said that he didn\\'t have a gun, and that Hartley exited the passenger side of the white Tahoe and shot Chumney in the chest. Hartley reportedly told investigators he climbed from the back seat to the passenger seat and Chumney ran toward him with a black and silver gun in his hand. Looking down and seeing a silver revolver between the console and passenger side seat, according to the affidavit, Hartley allegedly grabbed the revolver and yelled to Chumney, \"If you don\\'t stop, I\\'m gonna shoot your a * * .\" Hartley allegedly shot Chumney, started kicking him, panicked and fled on foot, the affidavit said. . .'",
  "Black Music Month: Debating Timeless Hip-Hop To Cope With Trauma T his started off as another critique of white audacity, hypocrisy and violence. A month or so ago I started writing a piece entitled “Comply or Die.” I didn’t finish it. Everything I attempted to write after was left incomplete. It wasn’t due to writer’s block – it was due to disgust. As crimes against humanity skyrocket, the chronic trauma causes resting screwface. Their words are no longer cloaked in differences of opinions or ideology. We know what this is: Truly “supreme” people wouldn’t have to work so hard to suppress evidence of their consistent acts of oppression. The deflection is to debate about 1619 but it’s really about 2045. They’re trapped in a history too entangled with our flesh and blood to deny social theories of relativity. DNA evidence is everywhere and totally contradicting their declarations of isolated happenstance. The body cams aren’t matching the police reports. Unearthed mass graves aren’t matching the body count in old news clippings. They no longer control the narrative so they’re muting mics and passing legislation to prevent critical thought of historical facts . This country is one big crime scene and they’ve been trying to cover it up since 1776. Recessive gene paranoia got them taking irrational desperate measures. Instead of maintaining an illusion of integrity while fixing the fight for an imperfect union behind the scenes, they’re simply choosing violence. In a country which Black Republican Sen. Tim Scott claims isn’t racist, what is the message of the Emmitt Till Anti-Lynching Act stalling in the Senate? They’re basically trying to unofficially deputize lynch mobs (that will eat their own) and create legal loopholes to justify vehicular homicide of protestors; well, at least the ones they deem support progressive liberal values. At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a volunteer militia Facebook group called Auxiliary Gestapo started by police and funded by the white wife of a Black Supreme Court Justice . While they get mad at cries to “defund the police” their economic anxiety would rather let victim settlements bankrupt a city before changing qualified immunity . Look at all these slave catchers fearing for their lives when Black and brown people blink, but just last week they let two white kids (who look like an adolescent version of Justin & Hailey Bieber) shoot at them with an assorted arsenal for over 30 minutes. Yeah, of course, they were arrested alive. One officer even called the girl “sweetie” while tending to her wounds. You think that would happen if the girl was Black?. Since we know the answer, our auto-reply is to hashtag Tamir Rice . Meanwhile, we forget our trending protest is most likely causing additional trauma to his mother and family. Not to mention the guilt and insult that comes with not listing John Crawford and all the others who died holding a toy gun, cell phone or sandwich. Same story, different Black life taken. That’s why, for us, the short film, “Two Distant Strangers,” didn’t feel fictional. In some ways, it was sanitized for viewers’ discretion. I imagine the director’s cut would include unbearable screams from Carter’s mother as we writers self-plagiarize film reviews for a story that ends the same, but somehow never ends. From Ramsey Orta to Darnella Frazier , acknowledging cinematographers usually leads to more police harassment. The state-sanctioned show is always renewed for another season and there is no pause button for us. Notification settings only allow for the option of nightmares deferred. And still, I scroll, bypassing videos of terror to the sensory overload of people escaping pain by posting alleged joy. That’s when I noticed it was Black Music Month and decided to use it as an excuse to make a list under the guise of an editorial. One thing’s for certain, two things for sure – taxes and no matter how many Black people face unjust death during the week, during the weekend there will be backyard barbecues across America with drunk uncles debating hip-hop. Since being Gen X places me in that avuncular age group and since we’re approaching a summer of vaccination roulette with family, I figure I’d too choose violence and increase the Black-on-Black crime rate with my curated list of timeless hip-hop songs. CRITERIA: Nostalgic, influential, iconic songs that cause reflexive head-bop, body-rock, goosebumps and/or the urge to recite the lyrics with early LL “I’m Bad” energy. The songs also must have the universal appeal that makes it undeniable to a 21st-century audience so they know to like it, learn it and respect it – or else they ain’t getting a plate. .

  "Woman never saw a gun on man fatally shot in Minneapolis by task force, attorneys say MINNEAPOLIS — The woman who was in a vehicle when members of a federal U.S. Marshals Service task force fatally shot the driver last week said she never saw a gun on the man or in the vehicle, her attorneys said Thursday. The statement from the woman’s attorneys contradicts investigators’ claims that Winston Boogie Smith Jr., who was Black, displayed a handgun before officers on the task force opened fire on June 3 in a parking ramp in Minneapolis’ Uptown neighborhood. Authorities have also said evidence indicated Smith fired his gun, saying a handgun and spent cartridge cases were found inside the vehicle. . The woman’s attorneys, Christopher Nguyen and Racey Rodne, said their client “never saw a gun on Winston Smith leading up to the shooting and she never saw a gun inside the vehicle — at any time.”. The attorneys did not release the name of the woman, who was on a lunch date with Smith. They asked the public to respect her privacy and her “desire to heal as she is recovering from this profound trauma.” They did not elaborate on the nature of any physical injuries she received; authorities said the woman had suffered injuries from broken glass as a result of the shooting. The woman did not appear at a news conference with her lawyers. They did not elaborate on her experience or answer questions. Smith, 32, of St. Paul, was killed as authorities were trying to arrest him on a weapons violation. The U.S. Marshals Service said he was wanted for allegedly being a felon in possession of a firearm and that Smith, who was in a parked vehicle, didn’t comply and “produced a handgun resulting in task force members firing upon the subject.”. Candles and flowers are arranged at a vigil for Winston Boogie Smith Jr. early on June 5, 2021. Authorities say Smith, wanted on a weapons violation, fired a gun from inside his vehicle before he was fatally shot by members of a federal task force as they were trying to arrest him. Christian Monterrosa / AP file The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has said evidence indicates Smith fired his gun — a handgun and spent cartridge cases were found inside the car. When asked to respond to the woman’s contradicting account that she didn’t see a gun, Department of Public Safety spokesman Bruce Gordon said the BCA stands by it’s earlier statement. The shooting of Smith happened in a city that has been on edge since the death of George Floyd just over a year ago, and the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright by an officer in nearby Brooklyn Center in April. . Smith’s shooting sparked days of protests in the Uptown neighborhood as his family members and community members have demanded transparency. Authorities have said there is no body camera or squad camera footage of the shooting. In addition, the two task force members who fired at Smith — one sheriff’s deputy from Ramsey County and one from Hennepin County — were working undercover so authorities say state law bars them from releasing their names. Nguyen and Rodne said they hope that commitments made by law enforcement to work toward more transparency and accountability since Floyd’s death “will will be borne out through their actions as we work to shine a light on why Winston Smith lost his life last Thursday while on a lunch date.”. . Jeff Storms, an attorney for Smith’s family, said the government has now heard the “people’s evidence” and the people deserve to hear the government’s evidence in the case. “There is a lack of transparency by the lack of body cameras. We now ask for the government to come forward and show us what they have to support this narrative that they created. now contradicted here today.”. The BCA said Thursday it will release all public data when the investigation is closed. Until then, the agency said, state law bars it from releasing evidence or discussing an open and active investigation. After the BCA finishes its work, it will turn over its findings to a prosecutor for review. The lack of body camera footage of the shooting has raised questions in Minnesota, as Smith’s family members and activists continue to demand transparency. On Thursday, activists also called for the removal of Minnesota officers from federal task forces, and they said the BCA should not be investigating, alleging there is a conflict of interest when police investigate police. Angela Rose Myers, president of the Minneapolis NAACP, was among those demanding transparency and accountability. “Just because a video didn’t go viral of Winston Smith’s murder, doesn’t mean his life didn’t matter,” she said. Local officials say the deputies on the task force were assigned body cameras, but were told by the U.S. Marshals Service that they could not use them , despite an October change in Justice Department policy that would have allowed them to be used. The Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office have said they will not participate in the task force until the cameras are allowed. This week, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Lisa Monaco ordered Justice Department law enforcement officers to wear body cameras when making planned arrests or serving search warrants. The directive orders the heads of the Marshals Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to develop body-worn camera policies within 30 days. . ."
