    "story_text": "Arizona's Senate race is really a test for Donald Trump . Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Thursday kicked off his campaign for the Senate with two strikes already against him. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has acknowledged that Joe Biden is president. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has been insufficiently enthusiastic about the election audit, declining to buy into the delusion that Donald Trump really won Arizona. Brnovich\u00a0also has two things going for him that any Arizona Republican will need if they want to win a statewide election in 2022. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has acknowledged that Joe Biden is president. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has been insufficiently enthusiastic about the election audit, declining to buy into the delusion that Donald Trump really won Arizona. Brnovich is the best known of\u00a0the Republican candidates and possibly the party\u2019s best hope of recapturing a Senate seat in Arizona.\u00a0\u00a0Solar power executive Jim Lamon and Michael \u201cMick\u201d McGuire, the retired adjutant general of the Arizona National Guard, also have entered the race, with others still to come. Thus far, however, Brnovich\u00a0has fundamentally failed\u00a0the only test that seems to matter in Republican circles these days: Loyalty to Trump. Brnovich already risked the wrath of Trump in November when he became the first Republican officeholder in the state to dismiss the wild conspiracy theories about the many ways in which Trump was robbed. \u201cIf indeed there was some great conspiracy, it apparently didn't work \u2026\u201d he told Fox Business\u2019 Neil Cavuto on Nov. 11, referring to the fact that Maricopa County Recorder\u00a0Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, was knocked off by Republican Stephen Richer. \u201cIt came down to: People split their ticket,\u201d Brnocich explained. \u201cPeople\u00a0voted for Republicans down ballot, and they didn\u2019t vote for President Trump or Martha McSally. So, that's the reality.\u201d. It\u2019s just not a reality that Trump will tolerate or that the Trump Nation will accept. While Brnovich has defended the Senate\u2019s legal right to conduct the election audit, he has not exactly hopped aboard the bamboo bandwagon. Trump has noticed. \u201cHe (Brnovich) is always on television promoting himself, but never mentions the Crime of the Century, that\u00a0took place during the 2020 Presidential Election, which was Rigged and Stolen,\u201d Trump said in late May. \u201cArizona was a big part and Brnovich must put himself in gear, or no Arizona Republican will vote for him in the upcoming elections. They will never forget, and neither will the great Patriots of our Nation!\u201d. Here\u2019s the problem for a guy like Brnovich and for\u00a0 Republican candidates running for statewide office in general:\u00a0. Failure to fawn over the ex-president can be fatal to your chances of winning a Republican primary. \u00a0But being spotted anywhere near the election audit that fully 55% of the state\u2019s likely voters oppose?. That\u2019s likely to\u00a0be hazardous to your political health in November 2022. Brnovich has a desert full of land mines ahead of him but early indications are that he\u2019s not going to follow in Martha McSally\u2019s fated footsteps. His campaign video, released on Thursday, includes all the usual Republican touches, including a shot of the border and an allusion to election integrity. But he also threw up a screen shot from CNN\u2019s election coverage, with the headline \u201cJoe Biden elected president\u201d. Brnovich gets it. If he wants to have a shot at beating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly he cannot be beating a path to Trump's door. The question is, does Trump get it?. If the former president is smart, he\u2019ll stay out of Arizona\u2019s Senate race and give Brnovich the breathing room he needs to try to win conservative Republican votes without losing the moderate\u00a0and independent voters\u00a0he needs to win the seat. In the end, Arizona\u2019s Senate race will be a test of sorts for Trump, the\u00a0opportunity to show Arizona and the world\u00a0what\u2019s more important to the man who holds the Republican Party in the palm of his hand:\u00a0. Recapturing his pride after 2020? Or recapturing the Senate in 2022?. Reach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com . Follow her on Twitter at @LaurieRoberts . .
