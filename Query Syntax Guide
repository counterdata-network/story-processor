# Structuring Queries Advice

- *Prompt*: I am looking for stories regarding Biden's policies on climate change
    - *Query*: Biden AND policy AND "climate change"
    - *Reasoning*: "Biden" and "policy" does not need quotes in the query because they are one word. AND is capitalized.
- *Prompt*: I am looking for black woman killed by the police.
    - *Query*: ((murder* OR homicide* OR femicide OR feminicide OR murdered OR dead OR death* OR killed OR murdered OR shot OR stabbed OR struck OR strangled OR "life-less") AND (police* OR officer* OR custody) AND NOT (covid* OR vaccin*) AND (`wom*n` OR `girl*` OR transgender OR trans OR nonbinary OR non-binary OR sayhername OR blm OR blacklivesmatter OR "black lives matter"))
    - *Reasoning*: First clause is identifying the crime.The second clause identifies the perpatrator. The third clause excludes covid terms because black lives matter occurred at the same time as black lives matter. The last clause identifies the victim.
